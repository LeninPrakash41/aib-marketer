1,TERRIBLE COMPANY!,"TERRIBLE COMPANY!! Please stay away and use a different company to drop ship with or find a new product to sell. Their platform is dated and feels like its from 2002. They have a ""chat with us"" box and its a bot and when you want to talk to someone it takes 24 hours to get a response (each time).They spam your email even when you click unsubscribe.They make you pay for a plan and then dont offer the services the plan says (they said they give you a list of the top trending and selling products, only to sign up and find out they no longer offer that)They will spam your email some more, and you will unsubscribe again.The products prices sometimes will set to 0 so you don't know what you pay for it.You can't find out what you pay for shipping easily, you have to back door your way through to find the product on alibaba again and check shippingDid I mention they wont stop spamming your email, no matter how many times you unsubscribe.I can't wait for the class action lawsuit against this company. I will be signing up and taking my cut back.Also if someone does reply to this from the company, the only thing I want is the personal email address of the CEO so I can spam their email like they spam mine.",Oberlo,Trustpilot

1,Impossible to unsubscribe from email spam,"I recently closed my Shopify account and removed oberlo from it - I am continuously getting emails from Caitlyn@oberlo despite clicking unsubscribe multiple times, emailing them direct to have me removed from their mail list - yet I’m continuously getting their spam...their unsubscribe/profile portal is a complete waste of time and no settings ever update - this is one part of a product that grinds my gears that you cannot willingly unsubscribe from company spam after you have ended the use of their product! Oberlo if you want to rectify this issue - please reply! And I will consider altering the review accordingly since no one bothered to reply when emailing the relevant support addresses!",Oberlo,Trustpilot

1,Oberlo: A Scam With A Smile,"Oberlo is attractive to new ""want to be"" drop shippers because they prey on newcomers in a fashion that goes against the integrity of good business ethics. Imagine trying to establish a good reputation with customers who have to wait 40 days for their paid for product to arrive. Oberlo's instructional material is saturated with video and written statements directed toward new Shopify store owners that try to convince them that their customers won't be turned off as long as you warn them ahead of time. So, imagine trying to attract customers and building a great store reputation by stating in your product ads, ""Due to popularity of this item, it will take between 30-40 days for you to receive it."" Wouldn't that just make you feel like you MUST buy it? Jokers. I mean, really, you wouldn't even think of ordering it on Amazon where you're assured of receiving it in three days, would you? Oberlo's software works just fine. It's their integrity that doesn't exist. Zero stars. I didn't see that option.Regarding  your  response below: nothing you stated warrants a reply. However, buyer beware. Major scam. Oberlo was put in place for vulnerable newbees to develop a relationship with Shopify. $29.90 per month is a ripoff. Find better choices.",Oberlo,Trustpilot

1,Shopify + Oberlo = Definite scam,"Oberlo is a scam.  Plain and simple.  Dropshipping on Shopify is a scam.  If you look at the total orders placed for items on Oberlo, I estimate 99% have zero orders.  No sales.  Every item has thousands of store imports.  (This means someone is trying to sell it on their own store.)  There are a few items that take off, but the competition is stiff and if you do the math for overall sales, they’re just, at most, a few hundred thousand dollars in orders.This sounds great until you divide that cost by the amount of stores selling those items that sell well, and find out on average you may make a $100 dollars tops.Shopify and Oberlo charge you per month (at a minimum), don’t aid you with advertising, and you’re barely likely to turn over $50 dollars in a month dropshipping while your costs before advertising can be $25-$100+ dollars at a minimum.  We haven’t even talked advertising yet.  To test a product with Google ads, common wisdom is to be ready to invest $1000 dollars PER PRODUCT; testing to see if ithe product will sell well with your specific audience set.  Facebook ads is quite cheaper, but not a lot, however, you have to deal with their inaccurate impressions estimates, and draconian ad review process.  This is the dark little secret of the “dropshipping”E-commerce model.  You have to invest thousands of dollars in ad revenue.  Even if you have the money to invest, do you really want to bet your money on a low quality product being dropshipped from China? Shopify dropshipping is a scam and Shopify wants to collect fees from you, while you think it is your own fault that your store isn’t taking off, but really it’s because Shopify and Oberlo dropshipping is an ecommerce model that does not work.  Avoid at all costs!",Oberlo,Trustpilot
2,The concept itself is a modern take of…,"The concept itself is a modern take of the old dropshipping catalogue sales model. I set up a shop after browsing through some of the products. As I built my shop on shopify and began populating my product portfolio and ofc.closely following the oberlo way of marketing, writing articles etc... and ofc. creating a digital marketing plan my store went live on eBay and on the web. After a couple of months I decided to take it down. I noticed more and more of the similar products being offered on instagram (every 4th post) so I took down my site thinking of focusing on yet another niche until that too was all over instagram. A couple hundred bucks and lots of hours later I decided I needed to rethink my business.Why? well Aliexpress and Oberlo have become so popular it is a very competitive arena. The only true success comes from direct advertising on social media, click rates are very low and expensive.  The products are mostly chinese knock offs and some never heard of junk. T-shirts claiming to be from Jimmy Buffet and others are not official and have spelling mistakes. The risk reward to too great as one has to prepay for all orders and hope the chinese provider delivers and can communicate. My thoughts... this type of model can succeed but needs to be worked on in order to become the go to dropship store model.",Oberlo,Trustpilot
2,I give them two stars because the…,I give them two stars because the prices are way to high I sell watches and a watch from them it says $1100 for a Garmin watch and my customers are buying it from Gramin direct for $399.00 so my customers are not returning to my store anymore.

1,More and more features are working less…,"More and more features are working less and less. Tech support virtually does not exist. Once you add products to your store you cannot access the suppliers or source pages. Which means you're locked out of updating any products or making changes. None of the links to suppliers currently work. I made Oberlo tech support aware of this several time, eventually, I just gave up, and now even fewer functions work. To me, it seems like some kind of juvenile punishment for speaking out and leaving dissatisfied reviews. I'm not going to shut up - instead of being professional and fixing the functions and actually providing quality customer service - things only become worse, and they expect me to shut up!?! This is my business and I lose money when I cannot access products in my store. The thought of retaining customers and store owners apparently does not occur to Oberlo since there is always another eager and naive person falling for Oberlo's fantasy business format only to realize after spending a bunch of their money and time - Oberlo is only interested in supporting and growing Oberlo's business - the unsuspecting store owner is not apart of that business model so most of us end up closing our stores in order to avoid bankruptcy.It's a win for Oberlo everytime someone starts a store and a slow failure for the store owner. Beware - do your research on how many stores actually close because of these and other slash and burn tactics. This is a slash-and-burn business model! With the store owners slashed and burned while Oberlo/Shopify make quick money then move on to the next eager to start an eCommerce store victim.",Oberlo,Trustpilot
1,Very Ordinary Oberlo and their suppliers.,"I closed my Shopify store after 4 months of failure from oberlo suppliers. I placed 3 test orders to check quality and delivery times and these were my findings:1st product - backpack from an oberlo supplier called Worthfind: product got delivered to to wrong country. Went to Austria instead of Australia. I received an apology and a refund.I gave them the benefit of the doubt so i decided to give them another try:2nd product - same backpack from Worthfind: this time it got delivered correctly and even came earlier than expected. However, quality was average, there was chinese labelling everywhere and didnt look like a $50 bag that i was charging (in order to make a small $20 profit)3rd product - another backpack this time from a different supplier (ironbotot or something like that). Ordered on the same day as product 2, but no sign of delivery yet. Been nearly 30 days. One product arrived, thr other hasnt. Summary: completely unreliable, unpredictable, delivery times unacceptably long, no guarantees on quality and packaging is dissapointing.I closed my store because i cant put my name to such shoddy and unpredictable products and services. And be forced to sell at high prices because oberlo products aren't exactly cheap tp begin with.",Oberlo,Trustpilot
1,***continued from previous post***,"***continued from previous post***Sure you can read Oberlo articles discussing how successful Oberlo users found success through quirky means and social media influencer marketing but the reality is, direct advertising will account for the majority of your sales and it is honestly the only reliable way to create a revenue stream using Oberlo products (if you can make it that far).- Supplier & Customer Relations -There are many suppliers in the Oberlo network that have poor/shady business practices or are completely unreliable altogether. That’s probably why Oberlo introduced the “Verified Supplier” badge to select suppliers that met their criteria. Despite this though, problems with suppliers translate into problems for your customers, which then translates into problems for you.Perhaps one of the most common issues you’ll hear from Oberlo merchants is that they literally can’t get a hold of their supplier. Their customer’s order is missing, late or damaged and you can’t speak with your supplier to understand what the hell happened. What does this mean? You as the merchant have to eat any losses that come as a result of any fault of your supplier. If your supplier sends the wrong product, a damaged product or a cheap product and your customer wants a refund - that is all on you. Your suppliers will ultimately reflect back to you the QUALITY OF YOUR BUSINESS and your customers will see that clearly. As a dropshipper using Oberlo, you are essentially at the mercy of the suppliers. You will only be able to communicate with your customer as often as your supplier is able to communicate with you. Obviously if you can’t reach your supplier, then you’re pretty much screwed. Also keep in mind the language barrier between Chinese manufactures and English-speaking merchants. It is often difficult to communicate with suppliers as a result and can leave room for plenty of misunderstandings and miscommunication.At the end of the day, your ecommerce business is only as good as it’s suppliers. It is without a doubt, a make or break point for your enterprise. - The Fulfillment Process -From a technical standpoint, the fulfillment process using Oberlo is straightforward, mostly automatic and pretty user-friendly. Honestly though, that means nothing when it comes down to accepting payment from your customers and getting their product shipped out to them in a timely manner.First of all when a customer buys a product on your store, the funds will typically go into your Shopify account (or whatever connected merchant tool you have - i.e. Shopify Payments, PayPal etc.). Then what you’ll need to do is head over to Oberlo to fulfill the order. If you are using Oberlo’s own fulfillment service this process is a little easier and less complicated than Aliexpress. If you have the Oberlo extension in your web browser, it will automatically fill in most of the required information based on the information your customer provided.Once the information is filled in, you will need to PAY FOR THE PRODUCT your customer ordered and have it shipped out to them. So you may not have known this at first, but you will need some working capital to get started with Oberlo dropshipping. Just because a customer made a purchase on your store, doesn’t mean those same funds will instantly cover the purchasing and shipping costs from the supplier. You will need to front the money to pay for your customers purchase and then recover those funds by withdrawing from your Shopify account into your bank or whatever you use. Keep in mind your payouts are not instant but rather at set points throughout the month. You will need to factor this in when budgeting your cash flow and expenses. Fulfillment by Oberlo is generally hassle-free in terms of actually placing the order (shipping times, product quality etc. are the headaches that come after that). If you’re selling Aliexpress products however and have to fill orders using them, buckle up.The Oberlo web browser extension will still automatically fill in the order information for you once you log into your Aliexpress account however, you are now working outside Oberlo which means any issues that arise means you’ll have to deal with Aliexpress for assistance.Here’s the thing Oberlo doesn’t tell you when you fulfill using Aliexpress: Aliexpress does not recognize you as a merchant. They recognize you as a consumer.This can cause of a wealth of problems when you are trying to fulfill your orders through them. The first is that they have a ton of automatic security measures in place to prevent fraudulent activity so if you have to suddenly make several purchases after no account activity through Aliexpress at once or are one day shipping your purchase to the UK and the next to Brazil, your account can be automatically flagged which means you won’t be able to complete your purchase. This is always great when your customer has already paid you and is awaiting their product to be shipped. Well let the fun begin because you can’t even buy this product now, let alone get it shipped, until you resolve things with Aliexpress.Basically this entails that you contact their customer service department, explain you are using Oberlo blah blah blah. Eventually they should get back to you. They will likely require proof of your ID and credit card, which you will have to submit to them in order to use your Aliexpress account again. Once you finally get verified and your account becomes active again (sometimes a several week long process), you can finally ship out your product to your customer. So now on top of the ridiculous wait time they already had, you can now add 1-3 more weeks depending on how quickly your Aliexpress account was recovered. Something else to keep in mind is that because this is an automatic process in terms of your Aliexpress account getting flagged, this CAN BE A RECURRING PROBLEM where your account may get locked out again. In my last days using Oberlo, I stopped using Aliexpress altogether. I had to refund more than half of all my customers orders because of delayed shipping times as a result of my Aliexpress account getting flagged for purchases.- CONCLUSION - So at the end of the day, Oberlo in my opinion is a fleeting dream. It may be possible to find success with this platform but it will not come to the majority of users. The most successful Oberlo users are already established and selling. It’s probably going to be too late to get in on selling hot items like watches, sunglasses or artwork, that made these Oberlo users successful, as most of your target audience has been bombarded with these ads already. To have success using Oberlo in my opinion at this point in time you’d need the following:A niche market mostly untouched by other Oberlo usersPlenty of working capital to get started ($5000+)A refined and highly detailed marketing planVerified suppliers using only Oberlo fulfillmentTest/purchase all the products you want to sell beforehand to inspect quality/shipping timesOtherworldly ambitionA decent amount of luck I wish I had all the information I’ve provided you when I started. I would’ve saved thousands. Hopefully this information will be useful to you if you are just getting started. If you can find a way to overcome the barriers I’ve discussed using Oberlo, best of luck. Ultimately though, I do not recommend this platform. It is unfortunately just not a viable means of starting an ecommerce business. It does not provide the tools for success. My advice = look for something else.",Oberlo,Trustpilot
1,3 Oberlo Stores Later - This is What I Learned,"When I first discovered Oberlo, I was beyond excited to begin using this app in combination with Shopify to try my hand at dropshipping, especially after reading all the success stories using Oberlo. Now three stores later, I can tell you what I've learned.The Oberlo App & CompanyThe app itself is a well designed and functioning service with a good user interface. Oberlo makes it easy to browse and import products into your Shopify store. The main problems with Oberlo doesn't have as much to do with the app itself but rather, the inner workings of its network of suppliers, products and what I would call ""hidden"" information.The company has good resources in place for you (although I think many of them are a little biased as they are all directed in favor of Oberlo obviously). They have videos and blogs for how to get started as well as tips and tricks for dropshippers using Oberlo. Their customer service is decent in terms of professionalism however, this doesn’t always translate the same in regards to problem resolution.Hidden InformationCheck the Oberlo blog or look around online and you'll find Oberlo has some really positive reviews. Check out their blog and ""case studies"" and you'll see plenty of success stories for dropshippers using Oberlo. Dig a little deeper though and you'll see many of the blog articles that discuss the success of Oberlo users were written by Oberlo staff, so obviously they are going to promote their service. Look even closer and you'll see that the success stories are for a very small percentage of Oberlo users. You also don’t have to dig too far to see negative feedback and reviews from many Oberlo users.Here are some things Oberlo doesn't tell you when you get started that are crucial for your success:- Illegal Products -Even though all the products in the Oberlo catalog are available to import into your store, many of these products are brand-name knockoffs or counterfeit products, that if you import into your store and sell, SHOPIFY WILL WITHHOLD YOUR PAYMENTS because it is illegal to sell these types of products on the Shopify platform (this actually happened to me). For example, search in Oberlo for products from popular video games like Super Mario or The Legend of Zelda. You'll find tons of products under these categories. Even though these are available to import into your store, these products cannot be sold on Shopify. This is an example of ""hidden"" information that you do not know going into the Oberlo experience. Oberlo says: ""Oh yeah browse our massive catalog of products and import anything into your store. It's easy with just a few clicks!"" When in reality they should mention, ""Oh by the way, there is a TON of products that technically can't be sold on Shopify but you'll figure that out eventually..."" The reason these video games products (for example), can't be sold on Shopify, is because they are counterfeit or knockoff products. For Super Mario, these suppliers are not licensed by Nintendo to sell these products. That is why you won't see the Nintendo logo on any of them. China has some very relaxed laws around copyright infringement and trademarks and so these suppliers in China are able to produce these counterfeit and knockoff products with relative immunity while operating in China. As a merchant outside of China however, as soon as you start shipping to the West where copyright and trademark laws are heavily enforced, you'll be hit with the full weight of the law. This means it is ILLEGAL for you to be selling counterfeit or knockoff products such as these and you could possibly be sued into bankruptcy. Don't worry though, Shopify will likely close your store down and withhold your payment before that happens. This was a fun introduction into the Oberlo experience.- Product Quality -The Oberlo team will rebuttal this by saying you should always order the products you want to sell first, to review the shipping times and product quality (although you likely won't find that information for a while) however, the reality is essentially all of the products in the Oberlo catalog are incredibly cheap and disappointing once they arrive. The product images can be very misleading which can set high expectations for your customers and then truly damage your customers experience when they receive their product. As you might've have guessed, that is not a good strategy for a successful business. Your relationship with your customers is vital to your success and selling them cheap products is not only misleading, it's ultimately bad for business. Have you ever heard of Wish? If not, download the app on your mobile device to see what I mean. Wish shows you lots of interesting products and many seem to be of decent quality. Once you receive your order from them (if it ever arrives), you'll understand how poor the quality is. The same products you'd find in the Wish store, are the same type of products you'll find in the Oberlo catalog and honestly, if you have any kind of desire for ethical business practices, you won't be able to, in good conscience, stand behind these products.- Shipping Times -Searching products in Oberlo, you can see the estimated shipping times of the products you want to import. Already they are quite high ranging from 12-50 days which in this day and age, is unacceptable as far as consumers are concerned. The only way your customer would be okay with waiting that long is if the price they paid for the product was highly affordable (which it can’t be or you’ll make no profit on your markup), or if the product was good quality and therefore worth the wait. Unfortunately neither of these are true most of the time. Your product won’t be highly affordable because you need to make a profit and the product quality is so poor that your customer will not only be upset for the long shipping time, but they’ll be upset at the quality of their product when it arrives. After ordering off Oberlo, my quickest shipping time to Canada and the US was just over 3 weeks. That was the QUICKEST.Poor Product Quality + Long Shipping Times = Angry customersOberlo claims you can have faster shipping with epacket  or their US warehouses however, I never saw a faster shipping time than 3 weeks.- Insane Competition - Pretty much all the items available to sell in the Oberlo catalog are from Aliexpress or Alibaba (or available on those platforms). For those of you who don’t know, these are a massive network of Chinese manufacturers. Oberlo Supply is also available and this means you don’t have to go through Aliexpress however, the Oberlo Supply products only account for a small percentage of the Oberlo catalog limiting your selection.Basically all the products or types of products you can sell using Oberlo are already available and being sold on Aliexpress, Alibaba, Wish, Amazon and others (not to mention the thousands of other Oberlo users selling the same products in their store), and they are selling these products MUCH CHEAPER than you could ever afford to. Why? Because they are huge companies and they generate enough sales where they don’t have to markup the product as much as you’ll have to when starting your ecommerce store in order to generate a profit. Basically, you’ll be selling the same products as these major outlets but for more money. If anyone was to Google search a product on your store that you imported from Aliexpress, the search results would always turn up Aliexpress first. Always. So consumers looking for these products can go directly to Aliexpress, Alibaba or Wish and find all the products that you have available to sell but for less money. One of the reasons why Wish is so successful despite their poor product quality is because they can literally afford to sell these items for super cheap. I’ve bought $6 shoes from Wish and a $14 winter jacket. Were they great quality? Hell no. Were they cheap enough that they were worth the price? Pretty much. That’s why I was okay with these purchases because I felt I got what I paid for. If I had paid $40 for the shoes and $65 for the winter jacket and I saw the quality, I’d be furious and demand a refund, especially after these insane shipping times (sometimes 3+ months). My point is, if the customer doesn’t have to pay much, they might not complain however, if you sell a cheap product for a higher price, your customers will complain.- AMAZON! AMAZON! AMAZON! -What you may not know as a new ecommerce entrepreneur is that Amazon DOMINATES the ecommerce world. Seriously. Whatever you can do or sell, they can do or sell the same thing better, cheaper and faster.Why would a customer wait 15+ days for shipping from your store when they can buy from Amazon and have it delivered in 2 days with Amazon Prime for less money? Exactly. They won’t. When consumers search online for products to buy, Amazon is almost always the first result they see. This means that customers will never find you (unless you sell unique one-of-a-kind products), through search engines because Amazon will always display first, and likely for a lower price.What this ultimately translates into is that, you’ll need to rely almost entirely on direct advertising to reach your potential customers. This means your product markup has to be high enough to get an acceptable ROI (return on investment). Additionally, your ad campaigns will need to be flawless and refined in order to reach your exact target audience. This can only come with trial and error which costs a fair amount of money. So don’t be fooled by what anyone else says, the absolute minimum you would need for marketing your store using Oberlo products to begin generating sales is around $1000 (and I mean sales, not profit). ***can't post the rest of my review for 24 hours due to word maximum reached on this post***",Oberlo,Trustpilot
1,Not Fit for UK Market,"We're trying Oberlo but desperately looking for another dropshipper who can supply fashion items much more quickly. This app is not suitable if your business serves consumers in the UK. This is the 'next day delivery' era and waits of 25, 30, 40 and even 50 days is a complete non-starter. Great app, but offering a customer experience that is 10 years out of date. The same products are available on Wish for less than we are being asked to pay.If, Oberlo, you are serious, I have some advice: Please find dropshippers with EU warehousing for us Brits.Offer us much quicker delivery times, so we can provide the customer experience that consumers now demand.This app is a great idea but completely useless if you are serious about delivering exceptional user experiences on your website. The maximum delivery time should be 7 days.Very disappointed.",Oberlo,Trustpilot

1,Absolutely disgusted!,Absolutely disgusted with their customer service!  Upgraded to their $29 plan and cancelled 5 minutes later without using it as we decided to go with Dropified instead.

3,Maybe too good to be true!,"I’m giving three stars base that i READ that is THE place to be if you are a e commerce entrepreneur. Got my email confirmed but then i count sign in..NEVER!

1,1 Star for the Suppliers,"I give 1 star not to the application but to the suppliers they work with. The core of the app are the suppliers from China. The app works perfectly, it is affordable and has all the features you can imagine. It's a dream of a starter. At first steps everything is fine. You don't notice that anything is wrong before your first 20-30 orders. After that undelivered orders and wrong orders are piling up and getting out of control. The suppliers would not refund them and will keep giving standard answers like you have to wait for 1-2 weeks (when 1 month is already passed or the order was shipped to a wrong country) or simply reply with one word after your lengthy explanations, Why?This is taking so much time and creating so much frustration on the customer side that I would better not do any business than see the undelivered orders, unhappy customers and disputes piling up.",Oberlo,Trustpilot

1,Seemed like a good solution but ended up costing me my reputation.,"Seemed like a good solution for my Shopify store, but it ended up killing it. Ordered products directly from Oberlo's product selection. Made over 30 orders and only 1 of those made it to the customer within a reasonable period. Had 29 items ""returned to sender"" because the supplier somehow couldn't figure out how to ship teh rest of them. After many weeks, customer complaints forced me to start issuing refunds at my own expense. Oberlo was only able to provide an excuse for the shipping delay and issue all new tracking, which gave the same return to sender error. Giving this updated shipping info to customers with the same errors would have infuriated them further. Forums and blogs that I carefully selected to post my products that were excited to make purchases have all now told people to stay away from my store and suggested that my site is a scam since products have not arrived long after reasonable shipping expectations (even for e-packets). In this case, using Oberlo has cost me more than a thousand dollars. All of the time I have invested into my store and resolving these issues is not included in that cost. It's obvious that I have more control of the situation ordering directly through AliExpress then waiting for Oberlo to resolve things. I am currently looking for an alternative service to try, once I re-create a new store. It's unlikely I can salvage the reputation of the one I have invested so much time and money into.",Oberlo,Trustpilot

But other than that - I find everytime I email I get a very prompt response back . I highly recommend Orbelo !",Oberlo,Trustpilot
1,Horrible customer service,"Horrible customer service! Every time I reach their support, it took them 4 to 5 days to answer me except the first time when I have decided to install their App. That's ridiculous. I am currently left with over 50 orders which are marked as paid on Oberlo before I even pay them on Aliexpress. After I paid them on Aliexpress the app is not able to sync anything with those order any more. When I click on ""get tracking"" it loads forever and suddenly an error mesage says ""App can't read extension"". This is clearly a beug from the app as it has never happened before and their not here to help! Now I have to go to each of these single order, find the tracking in Aliexpress, paste them and send the shipping confirmation manually. Moreover, they are the only Aliexpress dropshiping App that does not let you use extensions to get cash back from your Aliexpress orders.. Will definitely switch to another competitor very soon..",Oberlo,Trustpilot

2,There's GOOD and then there's REALLY REALLY BAD,"DO NOT USE OBERLO SUPPLY. First, it takes hella longer. Ordering direct through AliExpress takes 14-25 days for delivery. Oberlo Supply, 29-49 days. WHAT?! On top of that, the AliExpress seller discounts must not apply because it's ALWAYS more expensive ordering through the Oberlo Supply order page. Unbelievable.Second, I had 25 orders that were ""In Processing"" for weeks before they were suddenly canceled and refunded to me because Oberlo says the seller was no good. I've dealt with that seller outside of Oberlo and there are no issues. So, I just lost 25 Customers, at least! Hopefully those Customers don't post negative reviews about ME somewhere. What the hell, Oberlo?!?!",Oberlo,Trustpilot

Customer Support is very responsive and open to feedback.  The only thing I wish it had was a place to store an unlimited amount of items that one has researched for later use (like a wishlist). As it stands now, one can only have 500 products total in the app and Shopify store (free version). I have to save these items in AliExpress wishlists, but it would be nice to have everything all in one place in Oberlo.",Oberlo,Trustpilot

1,Is this supposed to be a finished piece of software?,"Bad software, bad support.I could go on in detail on why this pile of garbage is some of the worst softeware I have ever tried, but Oberlo has taken enough of my time. But now they were cheeky enough to ask me to review their software.

5,Oberlo is essential to success in e-commerce.,"Oberlo has been tremendous in helping me with my new Shopify store. Without it, I don't think I'd still be doing this today. I have zero experience with dropshipping or running any sort of e-commerce entity whatsoever, and if Oberlo weren't around, there is no way I'd be successful in this venture -- marginal as my success might be so far.Oberlo does about 75% of the work of importing, automatic fulfilling, and simple data gathering you will need when you first start of. This way, you'll have more time to work on things like SEO, PPC management, etc. Oberlo gives you the freedom and flexibility to grow your store at a much more efficient and faster rate due to its founders having been early e-commerce entrepreneurs themselves. They understood and still understand the business model and they originally created Oberlo for themselves and to assist in the most important duties an owner/entrepreneur must perform in order to run an effective and truly efficient business. This is the reason why this application is crucial to early survival and eventual success in dropshipping and e-commerce as a whole.Without Oberlo, more than half of Shopify store-owners would have a near impossible time staying afloat. I cannot recommend Oberlo enough.",Oberlo,Trustpilot
5,Oberlo Rocks,"I've been using Oberlo app for a while now and It's just a great app to have.  It's complete automation tool for my dropship business that have made my live 10X easier.  Support is second to none, the plans available are feasible and a bargain for what you get.",Oberlo,Trustpilot
5,Love Oberlo,"An easy 5 stars from me.  Oberlo is awesome, pretty flawless and ever evolving.It make my life very easy runnig a high volume store.One thing I would throw out there. The training group Im in, teaching us how to dropship, a good few of the students have jumped ship to one of your biggest competitors due to the cost of oberlo with regards to multiple stores.This competitor does not charge for additional stores. I do not mind paying if i have a successful store but being able to add oberlo to multiple stores at no extra cost would really tip the scales as far as my friends who moved on would be concerened. Just a thought.Keep up the fantastic work.",Oberlo,Trustpilot
5,Great App. Has the potential to grow even further!,"Hi Oberlo,First of all your app is amazing. It's convenient and saves a lot of time for people. I don't usually do reviews but i do believe that your app has the potential to grow. I would just like to give a few suggestions:1) Amazon, Ebay, Etsy,other dropship websites It would be great if you guys can explore on how to work dropship for the companies above so that we can sync with other suppliers and not only through one source.2) Warehouse & StoringI believe your app has the potential to grow as a storage + warehousing business. Oberlo knows the amount of inventory going in to the website and can sort of act as hub for people who would like to store doing business in the States. Probably offer this to only your VIP customers? :) 3) Virtual AssistantsYes, the app is very convenient. However, i believe some business owners would like extra help for the importing of products as it maybe very time consuming to do product research + product importing at the same time. Is there someway we can hire people paid every hour or monthly deduction to import a certain number of products everyday into our website? Hiring people who have worked & are trained in Oberlo would be much convenient as to those who are not familiar with the website. Perhaps you could offer this service to only our VIP customers so as to not spoil the market? Hope you will look into these pointers into consideration :)Thank you. Regards,Audrey",Oberlo,Trustpilot

4,Good App - Even Better Support,"I have been using Oberlo since the time I started building my Shopify store. The app is very useful when it comes to importing products and fulfilling them. The support that the Oberlo team provides is outstanding.However, I would suggest a few changes that would make the app even more helpful1. Option to Select/ De-Select all images after importing them. As of now, the Green Checkmark and the border is too feeble to notice properly. Having a Select/ De-Select all images would give me to deselect any pre-selected images and just select the ones I want. As of now, I have to check all the images to see which ones Oberlo has automatically selected.2. Filter products imported by name of suppliers. It would be immensely helpful if we could have an option to filter imported/ added products by the name of the sellers on AliExpress.I could think of these two suggestions at the moment but I think I might come up with more as I continue using the app.Overall, happy with the app. Great job guys!",Oberlo,Trustpilot

After endless chat conversations, they informed me that actually annual plan does not comes with 14 days trial and it is not refundable. I found it shameful, that not such information provided anywhere, including chat, to push me to get annual plan. Of course I submitted dispute with PayPal. I will, get money back. But I wouldn’t use this app. Another reason is  that a lot of products they offer are from Ali  express, half and even more%% cheaper there than on Spocket. I could not believe that app, which suppose to help dropshippers, will use that platform to scam. Beyond disappointed. A reply from the company on my review disappointing. By text I meant chat. And no, when on the home page customers switch button from monthly to annual, there is no warning about no trial period or non refundable information. And during chat none of your representatives provided information about trial or no refund. So, no, this reply from company is not good enough.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Learn to do business with original suppliers,"I'll recap my experience:1)They say to have suppliers located directly in the US, but:-a)shipping times are often the same of - if not longer than - Alibaba suppliers;-b)products' costs are up to x5 times Alibaba, and the picture, as well as the name of the supplier, is the same as the Chinese platform.Dealing directly with Alibaba suppliers is a more reasonable option2)The whole system lacks professionalism: low range of products, insulting number and quality of product pictures, customer service that fools around you (they answered me, through email and after several days, with the same question I asked). You also can't contact the supplier directly to ask for info about the product you're about to sell.3)After inserting your credit card's data... they owe you. If you then want to close your account, they'll take 70% of the subscription fee for the next month(with your account being disabled!)4)Zero customization opportunities - in 2021, product and packaging customization is essential to run a business.5)They brag about being the platform with top-quality products... well, from what I experienced, they're not. In most cases, there is no guarantee or even a few days guarantee(that I've never used, it's like spitting on customers' faces), and also no procedure for refund. Finally, I thank God I order a sample for me, and I decided to close the account immediately. That was the drop that broke the camel's back.Guys, if you want to be entrepreneurs you'll have to take risks, but if you can avoid those... it's better.Learn to deal directly with suppliers, sign contracts, order stocks and sell YOUR product. This is what business is like in the 2020s.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,After an order (paid) was not fulfilled…and Chinise Alibaba products there,"After an order (paid) was not fulfilled by a company with a funny phantasy name (Me as a professional business owner was denied to get the real name and adress and company details btw), for over 4 weeks, and it was a nightmare to get ONE real person on the helpline who really helped me. During this process, this is by far TERRIBLE for every dropshipper, as the client pays you and it gets not fulfilled and no one helps you in TIME, we discovered, that that supplier is not based in USA  but a wholesaler from China, listed on ALIBABA for a fraction of price. No one from spocket gave me a logical explenation for this,Why am i paying the monthly membership, if i can get the same with Alibaba  for 1,80 $ per piece instead of 14 $ from ""handmade and shipped from usa"" without the membership fee from Spocket?This is irritating information, it may be handmade (but not in USA), and the product is from china with maybe an us american warehouse? who knows? and who is the mysterious supplier whos fantasy name is as nice as a plantetary system????? i m still waiting for my refund, and be aware, i found way more products from fantasy name mysterious companies on their page, all from ALIBABA listings for a fraction of this pricerange. And yes, there may be some nice little suppliers with unique stuff in there, but be aware. I learnt with them, not to trust them and not to do any ADS anymore,it s irritating and sometimes simply not right what they do. Why can i as a company not know with whom I do business and whom do i pay for? and who gives the feedback stars to the supplieres with the fancy names? as me as client cannot vote for them. I heard from the agents, its them who do that. that s intersting. Let  s all give ourselves the best reviews ever. Far away from reality. BE AWARE guys.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Beware of Spocket,"Beware of Spocket - they bait you in with the 14 day free trial saying you can cancel at any time, but, I signed in one time on December 2nd, 2020 and couldn't sign in ever again and repeatedly tried to contact them to cancel to no avail.  They do not respond to my messages to them.  If you get in a dispute, you need to contact your credit card company and launch a dispute.Here are some facts:a.	Spocket has no method to contact them on their website .  Take a look - no way published to reach them.b.	 Spocket does have a Facebook Page (click on the link at the bottom of their website and you will go to it, but, as you can see, their latest post was September 1, 2020 and, I have messaged them several times to ask them to cancel my account and there has been no response.c.	You can Google “Spocket Address” as I have done several times and, you will see, there is no Physical Address for them online, so, you can’t find them or send them a cease-and-desist order or call then (because there is no phone number either).d.	You can click on Google’s reviews for Spocket and, while their ratings overall look high, if you sort them by “Newest”  (See Appendix C attached), you will see that there is a steady string of complains from people saying they got scammed by Spocket too and that there is no response from the company.e.	While their reviews seem positive on Trust Pilot and other sites, take a look at the bad reviews and you'll see a reoccurring pattern.I am very frustrated with them and, since they want to keep fighting to get paid, even though they know themselves that I never was able to log into my Spocket account a second time, then they are going to face my wrath in posting honest reviews like this on every site.  I already posted on Google and now here.  And, I an not done yet.  Spocket - start acting responsibly....",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Fraud company,"Fraud company, they ask you to add your Credit card when you get a free trial, they keep your card information, email even if you cancel your account later, they work against GDPR. Ask yourself why Spocket need your Credit card information when you register a free trial?? There's no serious company will ask you to add your Credit card/visa card if you would like to get 14 or 30 days trial. If you would like to cancel your account you need to email the company, you can't do that on your account setting. I canceled my account and they charged me two times and they never answer you if you cancel your account. I talked with my bank and even report it for Police for fraud, Spocket not willing to refund my money back for two monthes. My bank canceled my Credit card and create a new Credit card for me so that can stop Spocket to charge me more. Don't waste your money with them, they will keep your Credit card information, your personal information and your mail even if you cancel your account. Some reviews here are fake, check their profile. I ask every one live in Europe to report Saba Mohebpour (owner of Pocket) for your local Police for fraud. I can also provide you my report against Spocket owner ""Saba Mohebpour"" that i get from the Police. Let's take action together and report this fraud person in all Europe countries and send our reports to the court. Lets our countries law protect us from this fraud person and his company.Please.... Please if you live in Europe report the owner of Spocket for your local police because his company doesn't follow GDPR, take action please. Together we can stop this fraud person and his company.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Update,"Update: Kim now updated the refund policy this week on their website to now say it won't give refunds clearly even though I have a print out of their policies from when I signed up and wrote them about issues with their website not working for our store and told them their agreement terms page did not have this policy and did not clearly state a section on refunds from cancelation. Changes wording to cheat customers and then says sorry we are sticking to our [new] policies. They are literally ignoring me on their live chat for over 45 minutes now, stopped responding after offering me a refund and I was being very nice, they just dropped the conversation. The prices are tremendously high leaving either no margin or around $1. Pictures from some retailers are very blurry, and the descriptions are poorly written so there is a lot of editing to have these ready to put on any website. I would not recommend, I have been scammed on their yearly subscription plan.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Misleading Subscription plans. Unauthorised Transactions,"I saw an advertisement on facebook for sprocket.co and this ignited my curiosity of what this website is about. When you go to their website, the only option that is apparent to view what they do is to subscribe for a 14 day free trial. I was charged USD 1,380 straightaway. If you guys/girls read the comments you'll see that a lot of the negative reviews have had billing issues. IT looks like their business model revolves around misleading customers into paying money they didn't think they needed to pay for services that they don't understand. I've started a dispute with Paypal and my credit card company, but after reading the other comments I'm not so hopeful about recovering my money. Well, If i don't get my money back, all I can really do is go on all the forums, review sites and improve awareness of spocket.co and their practices to make sure nobody else has the same problems.Update 10/01/2021They've emailed me in a robotic monotonous message using buzzwords like ""Policy"" ""Best Interest"" and said they won't be refunding the US$1,380 that they've charged. This reiterates the fact that they make their money from subscription errors. Try looking at spocket.co's negative reviews on shopify. there were 157, 1 star reviews on 10/01/2021, not sure if they have the clout to change that in the future. You're actually better off investing this money in the share market or even on gambling and casinos because there's a remote possibility that you'll get some use out of it. I'm also doing a google review today with pictures showing that the products listed on their website are 50%-300% more expensive than retail. Also FYI they've suspended my premium access even though they've taken money for my premium access up to 9/01/2022.Update 24/01/2021Still haven't recovered a single dollar of the USD1,380 they charged me. Was sick of dealing with customer service denying any obligation to refund, so I told them I'm going to raise a complaint with the ACCC, they immediately said they'll refund half my money. I didn't fall for that strategy, I said I want the whole thing back and pressed on with a dispute through PayPal. What was surprising was that spocket.co have very few people in customer service, most of their people are employed in fighting billing disputes and censoring negative reviews, because they've put a lot of effort in building a case to not refund me through PayPal. PayPal hasn't had a verdict yet, but we'll see what happens. I have a few other avenues after that. Not posting it now to make sure spocket.co aren't aware of my next move. Also, STILL NO PREMIUM ACCESS. I've paid For a service that they've suspended, and they're refusing to refund the money.Update 10/02/2021Finally got my money back. The whole lot. Spocket.co fought it TILL THE END.I tried disputing it through ANZ (totally useless) and PAYPAL, was thinking of ACCC as well but that's slow.THANKS TO PAYPAL I have my money back.I'm now going to start a Vlog about how scammy spocket.co is and why you shouldn't deal with them.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Awful Customer Experience,"I signed up for Spocket in 2019. The drop shipping thing didn't work out for me but through no fault of Spocket. So why a 1 STAR review?Their website is fundamentally broken when it comes to paypal recurring payments. If you have one you are told you have no payment method, there's no mention of a renewal date, no email reminders (plenty of product spam though) and the steps to cancel your account don't work.This happened to me. I got a paypal notification to say I had paid Spocket another nearly $300 for a service I wasn't using despite my account telling me I had no payment method etc.Ok easy mistake made. I emailed the customer service team to inform them of the mistake to ask for it to be remediated. It's a service I'm not using and I contacted within an hour of payment so pretty clear cut what's happened.NO REFUND POLICY. I explained how their own website was misleading and had led to this. I was then offered a 50% refund. To be honest I was still upset, I was being asked to pay nearly $150 for something I wasn't going to use but to move past it I reluctantly accepted. I've since been told the REFUND CANNOT be applied as I have cancelled my payment!? No explanation of what it means but they've decided now to just keep all my money. No real explanation of why the refund is not applicable anymore. All my contact with their help team has been woeful.It's hard when faced with a complete unwilling to resolve things like this to wonder if this is actually a fair substantial part of their business model and whether the offer of  a refund was ever genuine.When you sign up for a Spocket account you are effectively entering a partnership with this company. I would ask you if this is really the kind of company you want to work with, can you trust them to have your back on anything? I think not. Avoid",Spocket,Trustpilot

When I tried to get a refund, through 1 week of emailing back and forth, they said it's in their policy to not give refunds on annual subscriptions. I feel cheated, and helpless. And to top if all off, their app does not even work due to some technical difficulties. So I paid for an annual subscription for a service that I can't even use.

I already explained my situation in my last review but I’m writing this one because spocket commented on my review, everyone else’s bad review, and will probably comment on this one too saying that they’ll review our case and this shouldn’t have happened because of their “policies” which is a complete lie because I reached back out to them and the same bs happened again.

1,Unethical shady business,"I had the worst experience with Spocket about a month ago - I signed up for 14 days trial and a few days later I was prompted to choose a subscription plan so I hit the annual subscription (best deal) thinking if I decided not to go ahead before 14 days end I could then unsubscribe. Soon after, I realised $744 fee was taken from my paypal account, so I reached out to Spocket to cancel the subscription and stop the payment as I misunderstood the terms. I was told numerous times of their ""non refund policy"" and after a lot of back and forth and nagging they finally refunded half of the money. I still can't get the other half back even though I am not using the service at all due to limited range of products being shipped to Aus. Unethical, shady business it is! I would definitely stay away from them.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,This is a horrible,"This is a horrible, shady, stingy business. I signed up for the free trial and used it once because I realized that they didn’t have much products. This was in July. Fast forward to the week before thanksgiving and they charged me $196 just out of the blue so I thought it was a mistake and I asked for a refund. They tried to tell me that I’ve been signed up for the $49 plan for the past four months which isn’t true because I literally just signed up for the free trial so they must’ve put me on it. They also said that I was charged $196 because I had insufficient funds for the past 4 months which is completely false and they never once sent me an email saying that there were insufficient funds.  Then after a month of trying to get a refund they just keep saying they’re “sorry” it didn’t go my way. DO NOT do business with these fools because the same will happen to you.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,This company does NOT even deserve a 1,"This company does NOT even deserve a 1. They deserve a zero. I just paid my attorney a $1,000 retainer to go after them. I am also filing with the commerce and secretary of state. They pretend they can't cancel the charges, ask you to go in your account to cancel that you already canceled prior to the trial ended and can't even get into. They have charged me $102.47 three times $19.99 and today after 18-emails $99.99. DO NOT USE THEM.I set them up because I personally set up dropshipping accounts for companies and obtain all the products for free. But when I have a client that wants to use a specific company I will set them up with them. I use my account until I bill the client them release it to them. These unprofessional douche bags KEEP charging me and then they play dumb. I am livid. My attorney is looking up the certificate of service record so they can be served and we can go after them for treble damages. Even after 18-emails they are still repeatedly charging me. Today I finally cancelled my credit card that I have had attached to my Pay Pal for 11-years because of them. I use pay pal to protect myself but in no way was I protected. I am absolutely livid. I have 8-successful ecommerce stores and I don't pay for the service and I don't pay anything to obtain my products and I design the site.

1,Fraud company without support,"This company is really unacceptable.I created an account to test their system since they give fourteen days of testing.After I tried some products and saw that everything they provide is already on Aliexpress with lower prices and long shipping times, I left it as it is and did not continue to deal with it. On November 26, I noticed a charge to my account in one of their packages ($ 99 / month) without any message for trial expiring and without being notified that I will be charged.I contacted them on their website and all they told me was that I should be careful when the probationary period would end and that they do not have a refund policy because very simply ""you played and lost"" . After I asked them to connect me with someone in charge of this issue, they kept sending me the same message with the link of the non-refund policy.I did not use this service at all and besides I was not notified as they should for the end of the trial period. In the end, after a lot of discussion, they told me that they forwarded the issue to the relevant department and that I should wait for their response. The answer came exactly after 5 minutes with the well-known link of non-refund policy.It is simply impossible for such companies to provide services without control by competent services from the country of origin and specifically from Canada.So think about it before you decide to do a trial period with them and especially do not connect your card to their system before making sure that you will not see charges from anything !!",Spocket,Trustpilot

NOW, I am horrified to see AliExpress products all over Spocket.  People are selling AliExpress junk, marking it up to ridiculously high prices, telling buyers an astronomical retail price and getting away with this scam on Spocket!  This is terrible fraud.  People LOOK at ALIEXPRESS.com, find the product and then look at what those Spocket sellers are making off of you!  These Chinese suppliers have warehouses in the USA, but they don't always ship from them.  And why would you use Spocket when you can go to AliExpress directly and get the same Chinese junk to sell yourself?  You're just adding a thick layer of middle man with Spocket.

Let me explain, I signed up put my card information in, and picked the $19 plan. Just to try it out. However it immediately signed me out. So when I logged back in I looked around and decided it wasn’t for me... so I tried to cancel only to find out I never picked a plan. At that point, I couldn’t add items to my list or anything. I literally didn’t have a plan. BUT WAIT THERES MORE, several days later I see charges on my card for “sprocket” and a foreign country fee because my card was MasterCard. Needless to say I was pretty upset and so I contacted the company who said I no longer had a plan but that they wouldn’t be refunding me the money because “they don’t do that”.",Spocket,Trustpilot

And then they charged me again. I was testing them out for a client ecommerce site that needed to have product filled in the beginning. DO NOT USE. Your CC info isn't safe with them.

1,DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY,"If you read this before you start working with Spocket, save yourself the time - honestly, they are the biggest load of crap I've come across. First off, they only have good reviews because they offer a free trial to one of their more expensive packages if you leave a review (which leads people into leaving a positive review before they've actually used & experienced the Spocket awfulness). They say they ship products from EU, USA - they don't. Stuff ships from China and takes ages, we're just lucky we did test runs before we went live. 5 different test orders, every single one shipped from China & took ages, as I write this some orders that were submitted over 3 weeks ago have not left China yet. That would be fine if you are aware and expecting that, but don't sell yourself as being this solution to EU/USA drop shipping and then just ship from China, a complete farce. Their customer service is nonexistent, and I'm not being over the top here, it's truly awful. Just read some of the other reviews. Takes them weeks to reply, and live chat is the worst I've experienced. They simply won't have the answer you need and will 'look into it' -  you won't hear back, trust me I know. When we tried to end our payment plan, they continued to take money from our account despite us trying numerous times to cancel. We'll have to report them as fraud. A truly awful experience and a company I highly recommend avoiding like the plague.

My customer ordered a luxury dog bed and 2 blankets, and received a dog tooth brush, pet corrector spray, a shampoo SACHET, and a lead which i can only assume was made for small pets such as guinea pigs.

1,Spocket has made my experience of…,"Spocket has made my experience of having an e-commerce a real nightmare!! They seems nice  and helpful in the beginning, but it’s everything fake. They don’t have respect for their customers. I have so many problems with them and their suppliers and I think no one deserves to go through everything i've been through with them.1) I payed plus $39.95 just for the shipping 1 pair of boots from Germany to Ireland and these boots never arrived. After several days that the order was placed/payed, they sent (to me and to my client) a “tracking number and carrier that doesn’t exist/match”. I had to wait a lot of more days for them reply to me and give some explanation, so they gave me a strange excuse that the product disappeared and they didn’t ever resolve the problem. I had to get in touch directly with the supplier that told me they don’t have the boots there and maybe next week.. maybe. It already 2 weeks waiting for at least a “real tracking number” and now they don’t even know when they will have the product there. I really don’t know what to explain to my client. It’s a shame.2) Other strange and very disrespectful thing that Spocket did... they put all my products from another supplier “unavailable” without letting me know before. W T F!! And I was doing advertising for those products. I try to contact Spocket team and get a answer again about what was happening this time and again they couldn’t explain. After few days I was insisting for an answer, then they told me that the supplier wasn’t more with them. Yes, seems that no one can bare make business with such unprofessional app.3) Now I’m still waiting for another order that was placed/payed also 2 weeks ago and it wasn’t even fulfilled/shipped yet. Im trying to get an explanation for what’s happening this time and of course, they still don’t have an answer for it. I don’t know what to say to my clients.😤😰I want and will leave spocket, but I need to delivery these products to my clients before I do that. I’m almost having a heart attack because this company “Spocket” and I could write even more troubles I’m having with them but I will stop here, I think you all already understood what’s is this unprofessional company is capable.RUN AWAY FROM THIS SHI... COMPANY!! Spocket ☠️👎👎👎👎👎👎",Spocket,Trustpilot

I contacted (very nicely) them multiple times to fix this problem, cancel my account, and give me a refund for something I never used! and it was near to impossible. I spoke with what seemed to be a bot multiple times through their email because for some stupid reason they don't allow chat support unless you have the $100 plan. Just wanted to warn others out there if they are just trying to sign up for a trial. I was exited about spocket and wanted to use them in the future, but after getting almost $200 dollars in charges for literally no reason I can only imagine how bad the rest of their support is.

1,Poor company avoid-avoid please1,"Poor company, they did charge me despite of everything and only to found out after 14 days. They still didn't want to refund me my 50US! This is too much! I am going to file a dispute!",Spocket,Trustpilot
1,Avoid - Avoid - Avoid,"Firstly the pros: quick to set up, easy to find drop shippers (though not so much outside the USA; and they're now pushing AliExpress!! That says it all);easy to list items and add them to your shopify shop. The cons: you cannot have a trial period if you pay yearly (don't commit to anything before a trial period!!), you cannot contact the drop shipper directly (even after complaining, I'm still waiting for communication a week after I asked whether my customer could exchange an item for a different size - customer angry, and I even more!), product information is not accurate (don't just upload it to your site; you'll have to make plenty of changes). Shipping information is not accurate (some items take significantly longer than it says; I checked with drop shipper, who confirmed it for me. Spocket still insist they are not misleading!). It takes ages for anybody to reply to any questions, whilst being bombarded with emails from a bot telling you how wonderful Spocket is (it's not!). You cannot leave negative feedback on their site (it just won't register; try it, and you'll see). And don't even bother talking to them; it takes ages for them to come back and they always have lots of excuses, but never real answers.Don't take my word for it. Just join them for a trial period and you'll see it for yourselves. And don't just install the app and import items - that's the easy bit. Just try to speak to somebody at customer services, or see how they're able to sort out your problems. As to deleting your account... let me know if you've been able to do it. I'm just waiting to have a fight with them when they take money off my credit card (may have to change accounts/cards before they do it!)Abysmal experience!",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Spocket Customer Service is the ABSOLUTE WORST,"Spocket is the absolute worst! Maybe their system works fine... but God forbid you ever need to talk to a customer service rep, FORGET ABOUT IT. This is clearly an automated company that someone created and the majority of the responses from customer service are automated. I own 2 other businesses and formerly worked in television as a producer. I only say this preface my review with the fact that I have made a career out of solving problems for a living. I do not come to the table with an incompetent eye. I'm in the process of creating my FIRST online dropshipping store. Spocket has made it a nightmare. To start, I created my first account and spent hours combing through products and adding them to my import list. Unsure of whether I wanted a store through Wix or Shopfiy, I was playing with wix templates and clicked to add Spocket to the design and low and behold magically created a second account under my same email address. This new account no longer had a free trial... or access to the 100 products I had on my import list. After spending an entire day going back and forth with customer service, a real human being finally stepped in who pointed out the 2 accounts. He said they'd work with Wix to refund what I was charged through them (I ended up having to pay for the pro tier after a rep told me to put my credit card info in and then she could combine the two accounts) and they'd handle everything. A week later, no refund. I contacted Wix myself and they were able to handle the whole cancellation and refund within an hour.During that time, I created another email address to create another account on Spocket to use for my store, so I could take advantage of their 2 week free trial while I figured things out. Upon connecting it with my Shopfiy store, the email address from my Shopify took over my account (which was the same as the previous Spocket account emails). Annoying, but fine. Things seemed to be going well at this point. Then, their ""customer success manager,""Kim emails me to point out I now have 3 accounts open under the same email... and can we close any of them? I request that all but my current account be closed. The next day I request confirmation that they closed the account, which would charge me in 2 days time. No response. No response. SHOCKINGLY I get charged for the account I requested to be closed. I spend the next 3 days sending messages to customer service. I have never heard from ""Kim"" again. An automated bot jumped in with a link to a resource on how to close my accounts. But since they're all under the same email, I can only log in to the most recent account. Not the others. Another rep named ""Lorena"" jumps in and says she's examined my account and I was charged because I'm using it. [Insert face to palm here]. I repeat the whole conversation. I jump online today and finally take screen grabs of emails and conversations and attach them so they understand what I understand. FINALLY someone named ""Prinz"" has responded to me and doesn't seem to be a bot. He has now just assured me of a refund, since he actually seems to have a human being behind him. If this is anything like my last help request, I assume I will also need to follow up on this in a week pending no results on their end. I REALLY wanted to run my store through Spocket. I love their products. I love their shipping times. I love that they come from the US. But I have had enough customer service nightmares in a 2 week period with this company to understand that I am going to have to find another way. Because if the customer service cog of my dropshipping company doesn't function at an acceptable level, my life will be a nightmare in this industry. Do yourself a favor, exhaust EVERY OTHER OPTION.",Spocket,Trustpilot

It looks like simple but really differentiate one supplier than other. My favorite was any supplier that over free and fast shipping cause the biggest obstacle for me was the shipping costs. 3rd. Made in USA. Yeah we need to support our entrepreneurs. Spocket connect us with a bunch of us suppliers which is great. I’ve been tried using a google to find supplier and manufacture but it’s not easy to find the right one that’s way this web make this part lot less easy for me. So if anyone read this review and still have doubt, I can relate with you.  That’s way just use the free trial one   If this is not for you than forget about it.

1,Spocket lacks rudimentary functionality and has unethical business practices,"UPDATED REVIEW (1/12/2021) -- After several months of trying to get up an running with Spocket, I'm back to leave an updated review (to hopefully save some people unnecessary headaches). Here's the lowdown, they have a decent selection of products, but nothing you can't get directly from the vendor yourself (these are vendors who independently offer dropshipping services), so it's up to you to determine if their high subscription fees are worth it. A portion of their catalog is inflated with garbage being scraped from Chinese marketplace, like AliExpress (you can access the same product listings for free via the marketplace's website). There isn't much quality control on the listings, so they are riddled with spelling and grammatical mistakes, and are missing essential product details. Spocket offers no ""developer mode"" or ""maintenance mode,"" so unless you're prepared to keep paying the high subscription fee, you risk losing your product lists and customizations (I personally had hundreds of hours and dollars invested into preparing product listings and correcting them). The ""Pause"" mode they offer is just an unethical gimmick, and you'll end up getting billed anyhow (Spoiler alert: this mode is temporary). They have unethical business practices, and refused to refund me over $100 worth of unethically billed subscription fees. I ended up having to file a dispute with my banking institution to get these transactions credited back to my account. If you read this review and still opt to roll the dice with Spocket, I wish you all the best, but don't say you didn't have fair warning.    --- END UPDATED REVIEW ---I have had a Spocket account for around a month (or longer) now. My first impressions were that Spocket might be a truly helpful source for helping me build some eBrands I am starting, but that it seemed like the subscription options might be a bit overpriced. The structuring is set up to obviously force the subscriber into a higher-tiered price plan out of necessity and not out of choice.There are a lot of products that can be sourced using the website, but I cannot speak to the quality of all of these products. It seems that a lot of their ""suppliers"" are just AliExpress suppliers, and AliExpress is largely garbage. That said, they do have some great filtering options on the website, which permit me to find products made in the USA, and products that are ""ethically sourced."" One just has to really search carefully to find decent products, so that they are not just paying a exorbitant amount of money to sell garbage from AliExpress or Banggood.Customer support is by no means terrible. They are usually prompt to respond to requests, polite, and helpful.Overall, though, Spocket is just not ready for prime time. And instead of trying to iron out the bumps, they seem to be trying to expand and grow more quickly than they ought to be, or can support. One of my BIGGEST issues with Spocket is that one MUST be on a paid account just to access the product catalog to be able to setup their website. That can take a substantial amount of time for anyone who takes pride in their work, because the quality of the product listings tends to be garbage. So, why should a user (such as myself) have to pay a subscription fee when they aren't actively selling merchandise? A user should only have to pay if they are actively attempting to sell merchandise. Perhaps, Spocket should add a ""sandbox"" mode that allows a user the ability to design/develop their site, but not be charged a subscription fee. While in sandbox mode, orders would only be ""tests"" and would not actually be processable (suppliers would never see them). I did order two products as ""sample orders"" from within the Spocket dashboard. The products arrived quickly, the orders were accurate, and the products were of good quality.So, overall, I would say that Spocket has a lot of growing to do, but it needs to do that growing carefully, in a calculated fashion. They have something genuine and useful about them now, but they risk losing that all if they just try to grow as quickly as possible, accepting every and any supplier that applies. Very carefully vetting each and every supplier and the merchandise they want to list on the site adds to the ridiculous subscription fees, so it would only benefit Spocket to tread carefully in this regard. I am willing to stick around a while longer to see what happens next, but I am not yet entirely sold that this site is worth the amount they charge monthly.",Spocket,Trustpilot
1,Spocket is total fake,"Spocket is total fake. They sell you an illusion, but all they want is to fill there own pockets with your money.

1,"Shady Company, Unhelpful Support","So let me start this off simply. This company is awful and you should find another site that delivers products for you. Once you start their ""free trial"", even if you try to cancel it within the 14 days, it'll keep the subscription active. Basically asking for you to contact their support.I was charged the amount for a subscription even after trying to cancel the subscription. Not the best thing but I went to their support chat for help. On average, they took an hour to reply to my questions. When they did reply, it would be something that was unhelpful. Finally, one of them managed to cancel my subscription. Though I come back the next day to see that they've taken away my full subscription. This basically means I was bumped down to a free member a few days after paying £82 ($100) for a subscription that was meant to last a month.I asked for a refund because they did this for no reason and made it so I couldn't even use their product. They said they put in a refund request and after 5 days of trying to contact them asking about it they said it was declined. They didn't tell me this without me asking them.In the end, they said the refund request was sent about the error for cancellation, not the fact they took away my subscription. They put in another refund request for my new problem and said it'd be 1-2 days till I get an answer. Well, cut to two weeks later and here I am.I decided to get in contact with Paypal and use their dispute system. I'd advise everyone who has had money unlawfully taken from them do the same if they used Paypal to pay.Paypal's support listens. Paypal support has a phone number you can call for quick help (during their business times obviously). Spocket may have a live chat, but half the time they won't reply and the other half they just don't care.Also you have to have a membership to get support which is dumb.Overall, this is a shady company and you should NEVER give them your money.(And no Spocket, I don't want to contact you)",Spocket,Trustpilot
1,I've had a false claim I was refunded…,I've had a false claim I was refunded on July 17 by 1 staff and 3 staff absolutely fail to accurately refund this. They're still trying to hear from their finance team and correct this after and abrupt email on Tuesday I dont want another day of this. It's August 6th and I am BEYOND exhausted with dealing with them. But this is their service at first they weren't even responding to emails and they have no email to call to wrap this up. It's now Aug 15th and NO REFUND YET. BEWARE THIS COMPANY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY IF YOU ARE NOT CONSISTENT.,Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Spocket does little to build trust,"Spocket does little to build trust. The communications are inadequate for someone who initially was considering a premium membership. Instead testing the waters with a month to month membership has fallen short of expectation.  Their communications forum for subscribers only allows favourable comments and people wanting their websites reviewed.  Raise a concern and that is soon on an endless 'pending' and you never get your concerns heard. There is no proactive R&D company improvements because they don't listen to subscriber feedback. Their FAQs are flimsy and do not adequately address problems encountered with using the Spocket app. For instance, what inventory may be sitting in your 'My Products' tab may be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT to what each supplier's inventory happens to be. How can customers be expected to order products that aren't physically in stock? Suppliers often don't have anywhere near enough stock to satisfy dropshippers.  The inventory syncing is inadequate, no matter what the settings, and I have tried a few. The suppliers come and go and you can be stocking products in your store that suddenly disappear from the catalogue. I can see why suppliers leave! If you raise a query, you will receive numerous responses that mean nothing, that the 'team is looking into it', and then you get a response that makes no sense at all.  I've had decades of experience in customer service and you just don't do this in account management.  To Spocket, if you think you can redirect my concern by simply providing an email, you are mistaken.  In Australia, to not offer people a refund for a subscription within a given timeframe is illegal. To not offer support in cancelling, and having 'cancel' buttons that aren't really 'cancel and refund' buttons at all is beyond contempt. Saba, maybe you should look at this company you have set up and rethink how you engage with subscribers.  It's currently unsustainable and it will have serious consequences when people start to realise their dreams they have invested spending hours on product descriptions using your app, which are just that, dreams.  It may be making you loads of cash, with plenty of affiliate endorsements, but to treat subscribers in this way does you no favours in the long term.  One day these negative reviews will stack up, and then you will be in damage control and rightly so.  In my world, the customer comes first.",Spocket,Trustpilot
1,Spocket has been absolutely terrible at…,Spocket has been absolutely terrible at not providing a refund after I signed up for the trial period - didnt import any products simply browsed and paused the service as I went to orbelo no upfront cost. $100 gone and the fb messenger staff never got back to me days later and the email sent has  went into the dark. Buyer be aware they dont have high ticket and niche products so it's more competitive and you wont get your money back at all!,Spocket,Trustpilot
1,Dishonest people,"All the 5 star review you see are not genuine. See yourself all of them are first time on trust pilot.  Here is the problem I had with them. 1, At the beginning before I start my monthly subscription customer service was great. There is no way to send a message to seller even though seller send wrong item to my customer . Spocket didn't help me. Simply reply was I will get back to you once seller reply to us . Its been 9 days now !!!2, Item take longer than expected . Even its clearly said 1-3 days you have to understand that seller will take extra 4-6 days just to dispatch the item. 3, Monthly subscriptions too high all they want their profit not yours. 4, spocket itself are busy to grow their reputation online by review themselves.  5, Doing dripship shouldn't be expensive at all and being success Shipping time is crucial. Ignore them they are just dishonest people.",Spocket,Trustpilot

2,STAY AWAY,"Signed up for a free fourteen day trial after reading about the service. A pop up recommended upgrading to be able to use so called premium items. After browsing products, I realized that their ""fast"" shipping times are falsely advertised as many of the items are listed 5+ days. The ""premium"" products are also products I've found on aliexpress (which are not premium). I reached out not even one hour later to their customer care team to cancel my account and obtain a refund. I was told they don't refund annual plans and it is clearly stated in their policies (which it's not- in fact, they had to send me the link to the policy which is not listed on their help page at all). I could see if it very clearly stated no refunds but that is not the case. I could also understand if I had the service more than 24 hours, but it wasn't even one whole hour.

They are trying all the best to keep a high rating in Trustpilot and other review sites with fake reviews. Just look at these 5 stars, all with '1 review on account'. That's an obvious scam, don't fall for it. They comment on all reviews here but not answering any emails.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,The WORST customer service ever seen,"The WORST customer service ever seen! A customer placed and order 3 weeks ago, I had to ask them at least 10 times why wasnt the order shipped. After a long back and forth. They cancelled the order because they just realized that the supplier cannot ship to my customers country (the country is not on the list of countries that the supplier can not ship). So it took them 3 weeks to check the status of my order. Even they didnt know what they were doing, in one of the multiple emails, they told me that the supplier was going to ship ASAP, but 3 days after they cancelled the order. If you wnat to grow your store, stay away from this app, you can not contact the suppliers, you have to do it through them, and they are the worst at communicating your needs. They dont take things personal, with this issue, every email I sent, was answered by someone different, but I'm pretty sure its just multiple bots answering, they dont read what you request.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Go Away Legal scam! They own us money and ripped us off! Being a pain in the ass to get the money back!!!,"Update: You are ignoring us, we have been messaging you everyday and no replies or sight of the refund. Careful this guys have lied to us and we have proofs of this. Telling us refunds been issues but no confirmation and still 110usd missing and they just keep ignoring us.After 2 months using this app and dealing with them I can only advise people to go away. This is what I believe gives Legal Scam a definition. After nearly 200 sales and over $8000 turnover, we had NO profit. The costs of this app are ridiculously high and the gross profit margins are very little (20-25%).Out of all this sales we had only 2 issues and they are taking so much time to refund us. It's dodgy, very dodgy. They stop responding when we showed them proofs that we were right. So we had to refund the costumer and received nothing yet.If you are looking into dropship, just Google for your niche and you will find direct suppliers, no good to have a middle-man, specially when are this guys.The pros of this app is that integrates very easily and to fulfill orders it's a click of a button, so it is quite convinient, however it doesn't keep any business running.The only way you could succeed with this service is if you find a product with a gross profit margin of above 50% (which personally I never saw one but this guys actually have tons of products, so have a look), or if you have a lot of organic traffic. If you have to pay for ads might as well not even start.There is fees everywhere! You not only pay for a monthly fee as there is a fee on every order. Most of the suppliers do not offer free shipping, so if you offer in your store get ready to take a hit!Be careful with the premium products!Customer Service is similar to shopify, they are always there but don't know how to get things done.The worst of this is that because of their products we lost our Shopify Payment Gateway, FOREVER! So do not add anything related to COVID-19 that Shopify is gonna block you for lifetime. We thought it wouldn't be a problem but getting a new Gateway is so hard and pricey.This service is really pushing us down, after 2 months of hard work not having things done fairly and having a loss of $700 really hits the feelings. I would not recommend using this guys at all. Specially when it is so easy to find direct suppliers.We are just waiting on our refunds and we would cancel this subscription. To be honest we haven't cancelled yet as we think they will use that as an excuse to don't refund us. That is the lost of trust we got from them in only 2 months. UPDATE: No refunds been given, they are ignoring and not responding and they own us more than 100usd. This is how bad this guys are. Legal scam, absolutely!I feel sad we worked to hard to get to this and I hope this can save other good people from failling when all they want is to have a fair business.Keep away from legal scams, this is one but there are many more. Keep hustling!",Spocket,Trustpilot

4,"so far, so good!","so far, my experience is good. customer service is pretty good. they reply to my questions quickly. the products are excellent and some products got good descriptions but others have missing descriptions like for the phone cases I looked at. there is no type of phone where the case fits. there is also no way to contact the supplier and you need to message the customer service to figure this out but the good thing is that the customer service replies immediately that's why you'll feel confident that your question will be answered. the delivery time is very quick with other suppliers. there are just 1-3 business days but I haven't tried their service though and I haven't proven it yet if they are reliable. there are no reviews shown on the supplier's page to know if the dropshippers are happy with the service that they are providing. there are still a lot of things to improve but overall it's the best.

5,Better list of suppliers who actually…,Better list of suppliers who actually care to write nice descriptions. Saves me a ton of time! Products themselves are decently priced. You won’t find AliExpress prices but it’s also more reliable.You don’t know how many times I wasted hours correcting items just for them to be gone from the store 2 seconds later. It’s a headache. But the suppliers here have been more consistent than what I’ve experienced on Oberlo. Spocket is a great resource! Hope to see you grow more!,Spocket,Trustpilot

Throughout my research for products I could market and  sell, I found that most companies were not as broad or candidly resourceful as you have emphasized.  I realize that every dropship marketing industry has its own borderline and specifics that are required to meet certain procedures and guidelines. Yet, I have not found one as feasible, without too concrete limitations. As a new member to spocket, I hope I have found the best, lucrative product marketing company that will give me the opportunity of a well earned experience. You definitely captured my attention of interest, to atleast give it a try. I look forward to a fun, exciting and successful adventure!",Spocket,Trustpilot

Branding is very difficult in the dropshiping world given that you have very little control over the products that you sell. This might open new possibilities and create opportunities. Shipping from Europe and the Us is also an added benefit given that thats where most of the sales take place.,Spocket,Trustpilot

Firstly, I didn't even get a chance to be confused by their layout.  Often, I'm found scratching my head while looking at a new user-interface from an unknown company... This wasn't the case with Spocket!  They completely walked me through every step of the way with their integrated set-up tutorial for new users.  I really appreciated that.  Secondly, I am very very impressed by their wide assortment of quality items.  The diversity is what I was looking for in a supplier.  Spocket seems to have it all!  I can't praise my initial experience enough, and I will defeinitely be using this company for the forseeable future.  I would not be afraid to reccomend them to friends and family.

1,Total Trash,"Garbage, and fake positive ratings. I had two e-commerce sites that lost a ton of business due to Covid-19, so i figured I would give spocket a try for one last effort to stay going, obviously it's all ridiculously funky stuff, so I attempted to cancel with no luck through their mediocre app. The customer service was absolute #%@! and refused to cancel by email. Luckily I did the payment setup through paypal, and they just walked me through the process of cancelling out any future charges by these guys. Whatever you do, DO NOT give these people your credit card info, you can easily cancel any billing through PayPal.",Spocket,Trustpilot
1,Spocket is a SCAM,"Spocket is a SCAM, they charge people and they don't send invoice or receipt, once you have signed up for Spocket service there is no opt-out, you can only downgrade your account, so you are still exposed to be charged by Scammy Spocket until you deactivate your card. Avoid Spocket!!!",Spocket,Trustpilot
1,Fraudulent Scammers,"This business is a scam. I signed up for the free trial and deleted my account once I saw that the products available were over priced and low quality. I never downloaded the app! Yet when I reached out to the company trying to get them to refund the money they fraudulently stole from my   bank account, they sent me emails telling me it was my fault because I only deleted my app not the account. I never even downloaded the app! Dealing with them is a nightmare. I’ve had to cancel my credit card to stop them from taking more money out as it is clear this company is a complete scam. Do NOT sign up for the free trial. They will steals from you and you’ll  be blamed for it.",Spocket,Trustpilot
1,Scamster,"ScamWe downloaded app with supposedly a free trialCancelled within the app within the free trialBut like the other reviewers they charge the credit card anywayNo doubt they’ll answer this review the way they do all the other people that get scammed that somehow it’s my fault, that what they tell you in the signup of the supposedly free trial is wrong, that there is some other secret method I should’ve cancelled. Be careful. This is obviously their business model",Spocket,Trustpilot

You can't be trusted if you don't have an opt-out button on the administration panel. People don't use Spocket... DON'T trust them. Like the other bad reviews it's all true. ""Customer Service"" taking ages to respond...  A lawyer should really investigate this...  edit on comment:Settings > Billing > Change your plan > Downgrade to cancel -> no such option.

1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE, STAY AWAY!!I am new to the dropshipping business. I signed up for Shopify last week and then signed up for spocket. I wanted to do free trials with everyone so that I could see what I was getting into before subscribing. So I signed up with spocket for the free trial, prices were way too expensive and not suitable for my new small business, and BOOM! The next day my card was charged $396. Reached out to customer service, and what was supposed to be two days took a WEEK just for them to tell me that I signed up for the pro plan (WHICH I DID NOT!!!) and that I would not be refunded my money. Awful!! I’m a single mother just starting out and that’s $396 down the drain. I am going to make sure everyone is warned of this company!UPDATE:In response to your message, please tell me how I do not qualify for a refund? I got charged on day TWO of a FOURTEEN DAY free trial. I never upgraded a plan, my free trial wasn't even completed. I have filed a dispute with my credit card company. You can say what you want, but you ILLEGALLY charged my card. I was supposed to have a 14 day trial, yet I was charged on the second day of my ""trial"".",Spocket,Trustpilot
1,It's a big rip off,"It's a big rip off. Do not subscribe, big mistake for me as I subscribed for an annual plan. Limited list of suppliers and I am not even sure if those are real suppliers because it feels like they are dropshippers too. Only one decent supplier but the items are overprice and cannot personalized the invoice under my shop's name.",Spocket,Trustpilot
1,STAY AWAY,"STAY AWAYMy nightmare with Spocket began 6 months ago. I liked the idea to have a subscription with them because It was a good possibility to add more products to my existing online store, that has been in the market for many years with a policy of same day shipping and great reputation, until spocket showed up. What a nightmare.The first problem that I had and kept having during my subscription, was the delay in shipments, the suppliers take more than what they say, which caused me a lot of chargeback fees and a lot of bad reviews. I still, after requesting the cancelation of the subscription, have 2 pending orders, one of those has a delay of more than 1 and a half month and the other more than 1 week delay, and this has happened many times.The second mayor issue happened when Spocket sent me, after 20 days without shipping an order, an email saying that I had to pay extra $70 dollars to ship the product, because the supplier was saying that. And Im talking about a little fanny bag. When I complained, first they cancelled the order without my consent, and then I complained for that and they told me, that if I wanted to reopen the order and ship it, I had to pay extra $70 dollars. After many chats with ramdom customer service people, finally, they reopened the order and ship it.The third problem and maybe the worst. One of its suppliers, that I picked to sell more than 100 products in my marketplace, is a complete scam. I had to refund and received returns of a lot orders because the photos of the products does not correspond in quality and design with the products delivered. After checking out everything I discovered that the photos of the swimshorts are renders made on a computer and are not photos of real products. (all this was shared on time with customer service, that is more like a psychologist who listen you but does not solve anything).I even requested refunds in some of the issues that I had and I refunded the customers, but the answer from customer service was always in circles, and always saying that they were going to send my request to financial, but never ever financial contacted me, and of course, never received a refund.My nightmare was almost every week, I got a lot of bad reputation and I never reported spocket or had a bad review, Because as a business owner I know how horrible is a bad review, and I never leave bad reviews. But after the last 1 month delay and a horrible review from a customer to my business I took the decision to tell my experience with a 1 star review. Immediately as magic somebody contacted me and offered me 3 free months to delete the message. Clearly I felt offended for the offer, I was not requesting to continue the subscription I was just cancelling this nightmare. But then they offered me refund me the value of 3 subscriptions to delete the comment. And my question was, but who is going to delete the comments of my customers on my social media?, this is insulting.But after a lot of time expressing my disappointment with this company I gave up, and I accepted to delete the comment if they cancel my subscription and refund me the value of 5 monthly $49 subscription. That was not going to repair all the damage this company made to my business, at least they were going to cancel my subscription.They waited on the phone to confirm that I deleted the comment, and after I did it, they confirmed me that they were going to refund me the value of 5 monthly subscriptions.Ok, the nightmare continued when I walked up in the morning and they refunded 4 times $19 dollars, but not only that, they were saying that refunded to expired credit cards. So they do not only bribed me, waited for me to do my part of the agreement, but also they did not comply with their part of the agreement.I dont know how this company is still in the market, and by the way guys, NOBODY is going to be rich or have a decent income, selling overpriced products, that are not shipped, that the photos are not the same as the delivered products, the customer service does not work at all, and do not maintain their word and any other marketplace sells the same products for less money.This is my experience, and has been a nightmare since week 1. And it keeps going and going, because, they made me delete my review, they have not delivered the delayed products from open orders, but also they sent the supposed refund (to delete the comment) for less than half of what they promised to an expired credit card.Never again Spocket.By the Way, the following is the last message the person from financial sent me today, how charm:""Ok thank you Andres. We do have sufficient evidence that we have provided you a full refund via Stripe. So we have maintained our end of the agreement, and we were, in fact, offering to go above and beyond. We will now engage our legal team as well if you feel that is the best course of action."" KayleeTo be clear, I have explained many times that they are ""refunding"" the money, which is not the amount we agreed, to EXPIRED CREDIT CARDS, that no money is going to enter my account, but they keep saying the lie, because their interest is the DELETE THE COMMENT.I don't want to have business with a company that is damaging my reputation, but also is charging to damage my reputation, but also every time one of my customers place an order I can not sleep because I dont know if they are going to ship the order on time, or if I have to pay extra to ship it, or if the product has poor quality, does not look like the photos, or any other problem. A nightmare in progress!!!",Spocket,Trustpilot
5,"Easy set-up, loads of choices, excellent support","I'm new to dropshipping so as you may well know, I was a bit worried with starting my Shopify store. Then I heard about Spocket (was actually one of the apps that appeared immediately when I searched the app store. Super easy set-up!! You can start importing products to your store after just a few steps. Was also able to search their catalog and definitely had a lot of the products I want. And their customer support? Just wow y'all lol I usually expect responses to take a while with most services but after just about a few seconds I already has someone chatting with me! I would definitely recommend it, even for beginners. They offer a 14-day free trial so you can test the waters a bit, which I think is pretty convenient if you're still unsure about what your dropshipping store should be about.",Spocket,Trustpilot
3,Seemed so great at first,"Seemed so great at first - good integration with Shopify, relatively easy to understand. But then I actually started getting orders. I was so excited! I had made a substantial investment and was eager to break even. But as orders came in, they sat in 'processing' for days, and then weeks. Enquires to Spocket didn't bring me any answers. They kept telling me they were contacting the suppliers directly. But this happened on different orders, all with different suppliers, so I believe there is some underlying technical issue they will not admit to. Very disappointed after having invested so much to get this off the ground.",Spocket,Trustpilot
1,Improve customer service,"Improve customer service. Technical issues and integration need to be improved  Pros: United States shipping,   Cons: stripe payments, Woocommerce integration interferes with other dropshipping integrations, technical team is not available through the chat customer service which is horrible when your store is operating.The stripe thing is very troubling. They wouldn’t accept any cards for the supplier order but they do accept your monthly payments. I don’t know why it happens but they simply say we’ll contact our tech team. Wholesale2be is foreign shipping but they have less technical problems as spocket.",Spocket,Trustpilot
2,Spocket has potential,"Spocket has potential, it offers a variety of items & new suppliers weekly which is beneficial for many businesses. I thought it was a great opportunity for my business and was so excited to utilize, but as I began processing orders I quickly realized there were some small and serious kinks. The greatest take away is the customer service. Some of the issues I experienced were:1- Suppliers changing location,  I experienced a supplier I initially added to my store as a US Based supplier, switched to China at some point. I did not notice this until an order was placed and I identified it was now listed as China. Unfortunately took weeks for my customer to retrieve the order. I do not want to ship items from China and there should be a way to notify merchants when suppliers switch their shipment country. 2- Suppliers changing prices. I experienced a supplier who had an item listed for $30. When a customer ordered this item (weeks later) the price of the item had doubled, to $60. I had a -50% profit due to this. I was never notified of price changes for imported items and had to take the hit. Some suppliers are VERY over priced and there is not a great profit for merchants in a competitive industry. Overcharging= low customer volume. 3- Sizes missing, sometimes suppliers are out of stock on sizes but you are still able to import the item to the store. When importing- it will only add the available sizes. When the supplier re-stocks that missing size, it does not automatically integrate to your store UNLESS the size was initially there when you added to the store. The resolution is to keep an eye on the product for re-stock, remove it when it does restock and add it back. Not efficient. 4- Cancellation of plan takes 24-48 hours. In my case- cancellation was not completed until the 48th hour.  5. Supplier payments not going through- 50% of my purchases through spocket experienced a supplier payment error. This delayed processing and shipment to the customer. 6- Inability to ""favorite"" suppliers- Spocket has a large amount of suppliers **GREAT THING!!*** They all have very unique interesting names and with so many suppliers, it's hard to remember the name of your favorite ones to check back on for new items. 7- Out of stock items aren't always automatically updated, I did have an occurrence where an order was placed and I immediately received notice it was cancelled because it was out of stock. Not a fun thing to go back to your customer with. I will say, customer service is receptive- sometimes takes a bit to have a resolution on the issue but they do follow up and they do take the time to listen to you. However, as a business, your customer service is dependent on the quality and hassle-free experience you have with your suppliers. It is unfortunate that I experienced a great amount of issues in such a short period of time as I am reading some great experiences others are having. Maybe it's been a coincidence. Nonetheless-I would consider Spocket again in the future once all the kinks are ironed out.",Spocket,Trustpilot

I also found Spocket super useful when it came to finding a demanded product to sell and Spocket is also very clear about the reliability of each supplier.

5,Great app with lots of top rated…,Great app with lots of top rated suppliers.  The added bonus is the community of experienced drop shippers to help you with any questions you have.  The suppliers are already vetted so you know you are getting quality from the start.  The content on Spocket gives you ideas of products you wouldn't think of on your own and that's a big help!  App has a very easy layout to understand and get up to speed very quickly.  I'm using other shippers but I will be adding Spocket to my list for good.  This is a service too valuable to give up.  I'll be telling all my entrepreneur friends about Sprocket!  I can't say thanks enough!,Spocket,Trustpilot
5,Well done,Well doneAmazing,Spocket,Trustpilot
1,Possibly the biggest rip off you may…,"Possibly the biggest rip off you may experience, as soon as I installed the app to my shopify account, I get a message that says and I quote ""Give Spocket a 5-stars review here on Trustpilot about your experience and your account will be upgraded to Starter plan for FREE. ❤️"" So off the bat the reviews you read may not even be real or trustworthy. I haven't spent too long on the app because many products you find here can also be found on Aliexpress at a cheaper discount, and in some cases I have found products that ships within the United States, and total cost is still cheaper than using Spocket.  The only convenience is that the products (at least some) are purchased from countries like China, than shipped to Spocket suppliers warehouse in the United States, than drastically upscale to a higher price than you would buy from Aliexpress and sold to you. So if you want faster shipping than yes, buy from here. However consider the monthly/yearly fee they charge you as well as the cost per item vs Aliexpress.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Thought it was good at first but…,Thought it was good at first but started realizing their products could be sourced directly for less! Then Beware...many products lead you to believe they are US because they are shipping from here but I tested out samples that came from China! Might as well use Oberlo then for free instead of $49/month - beware if you sign up for annual and don't like it too bad - better luck next year! NO REFUNDS.   Hmmm...if they are so sure of their product why trap subscribers I wonder.,Spocket,Trustpilot
1,Free trial does not exist,"Free trial does not exist. Spocket promises a free trial but does not allow you to cancel. There is no information on the website so I had to chat with a customer representative. At first, he accepts my wish to cancel but three days later comes back to say they cannot accept for some bogus reasons asking me to agree. Of course I do not agree, but then they charge my cc anyway and stop any further communication. Avoid Spocket at all cost.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,Their premium plans,"Their premium plans, starting at $50/month are too expensive for start-up dropshipping stores. With their free Basic plan, you can only push 5 products to your store which is dumb. And yes, the 5 star reviews here are obviously fake. Most of them came from people who are bribed. So beware, people.",Spocket,Trustpilot
3,I think the advertising of this app…,"I think the advertising of this app needs to be seriously looked at. On every site it claims Spocket is US/EU but that is categorically not the case. I have so far found zero suppliers from the EU.Almost all of the suppliers are from China with the typical 30 day lead time, which has now become a public hate that pushes them back towards local retailers and any suppliers that are in the US only ship domestically.The advertising for this app should read US and The Far East only. All other zones, don’t bother.",Spocket,Trustpilot

1,It's a Scam of an App,"Do not trust this app.  Products continuously are removed from Spocket but you're never notified.  I had products on two stores from Spocket, and when you went to place an order, the product was no longer list in Spocket.  Also, they removed 1/2 my inventory when they cancelled a vendor on Spocket during Black Friday week.  The vendor carried kid's costumes for Halloween, but also cute Santa and Reindeer costumes kids could wear during Christmas.  AND one products took 2 weeks for a customer to get, instead of one week.  Spocket never cared about this.  I emailed them, but once the customer received their item, they no longer responded. And if you need to do  return...GOOD Luck.  You have no idea what to do.  You have to email Spocket and wait until they respond and then wait for them to contact the vendor.  Requests for a credit were not given as Isha from Spocket says Spocket is is ""compared to Netflix"" and ""a voluntary purchase"". DO NOT DOWNLOAD APP!",Spocket,Trustpilot

5,Surprisingly great experience,"Let me begin by saying that I am a marketing manager in the states and I've always wanted to start my own e-commerce store as a side hustle. I'm techsavvy but not a guru by any means. In fact, I tried building a store twice and ""failed"" twice. I would always get stuck after building the website because it got overwhelming and it wasn't as perfect as professional stores.So then I saw the ads for AliDropship premier websites and I decided to take a leap of faith and purchase the website, sellvia and marketing packet. I am so glad I got all 3. First. Tatyana was super kind and she was super easy to work with. The website was done in about a week. I know that it's a replica of other stores that are out there, but as dropshippers, you are just trying to get a piece of the pie!The website given to me was so clean and surpassed my expectations on how ready-to-go it was. All the settings were perfect, the email confirmations were set up, the payment system was set up. It would have taken me a month of work to get there. All that was left for me to do was create a facebook and instagram page and begin promoting.This is why I was so glad to get the Marketing packet as well. I am not very savvy in facebook marketing and was about to buy a $1,000 course to teach me. But the marketing packet taught me EVERYTHING I needed to know. I followed all the steps to a T! I was thinking, wow, I would have paid $500 just for this marketing packet! Lol!I followed all the steps precisely and within 2 weeks I made 2 sales!!! I spent maybe 20 hours focusing on building my facebook ads that were given to me by Alidropship. I'm not sure if I will ever get ""$200,000/month"" for this store as advertised, but being able to get creative and test facebook ads is the most exciting part for me. Thank you Tatyana and AliDropship!",Alidropship,Trustpilot

4,"Very structured approach, delivered what I ordered!","The team is very structured and detailed. The process is one step at a time, and as long as you respond to all their inquiries in time, the project keeps moving along. They delivered exactly what I ordered, a fully functional store. It is my project to make this a successful store, and I will need to learn more about SEO and social media marketing to actually accomplish that, but I knew that before I made the purchase. If you don't work on the SEO and marketing, nobody is going to find your website. It's not rocket sciense.The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I've experienced that the documentation they provide you both during the project as well as upon completion, is not always accurate. I think they sometimes give you step by step instructions on how to do something with screenshots, and while that is really helpful, unfortunately they are not always up to date and when some of these websites made changes (wordpress, paypal and stripe), the steps and images they provided are not accurate. Other than that, a great product that saves you time so you can focus on learning how to launch a webstore. Again: you buy a store, but it's up to you to make it work and get it exposure so that people find you. There isn't some magic button for that.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

1,Don't Waste Your Money! Do Your Research on Ali Dropship!,"Dreadful company, they do not deliver what they say they will. I was told I would be buying a premium store, they confirmed this would not be identical to others, however I have since found ten other identical stores that even have the same logo, using someone else's logo could land you in big trouble! This is the email I've sent to them, you can see for yourself there are many identical stores out there. Save your money, find a better dropship provider! ""Hi, Could you please let me know to whom I may direct my complaint to regarding my purchase of a ""premium store"". I have been extremely disappointed to find several stores all with the same logo, website, products, branding. I've so far found TEN stores which are identical to mine in everyway, the only difference being the name. This is also identical to your automerch store, there are also many with the same logo and name as automerch. It seems to me you choose a logo, sell it to x amount of clients then choose a new logo. But you're failing to tell people that you're recycling the logo, as this is illegal. Please see email thread between myself and Alex, who assured me my website would not be identical to others. To give several companies the same logo seems to me like copyright infringement, this is also not what your advertising to people. I was not told I would be buying an identical replica of hundreds of other stores and that I would be using the same logo too. This makes it impossible to build a brand. I have also noticed that your automerch store has several Instagram accounts and the company seems to have done minimal trading last year and nothing else. I would like to speak to someone about this as I do expect a refund in full as the website is completely unusable and not what I was told I would be buying. Please see links below of the identical websites I've found so far, this only took me about ten minutes to find these which concerns me, how may other identical ones are there and how many other companies are using our logo? These are all the identical stores to mine, including logo:azautostore.comstuff4auto.comcarpartshealth.comautomerchspot.comautomerchclub.comautomerchworld.comridemerch.comgadgetyourcar.comInfinity-Fasterautoniceshop.comThese companies appear to have the same name but different logo or the same logo but different name to your auto merch store:theautomerch.comjaysautomerch.comtheautomerch.shopI will wait for response.""",Alidropship,Trustpilot

My product manager, Anna, still answers my questions today. And Irina from the support is so fast to answer to my most technical questions ! Would totally recommend Alidropship.

I think it is user-friendly.I did not launch or promote my store and post any ads immediately when my store was ready. Therefore, as a novice, I accepted the AliDropship Marketing Adviser's suggestion to purchase the Marketing Services Bundled (Promotion), Add-Ons, and setup service recently. The Marketing Services Bundled allows me to promote my store on social media. I was very impressed by the AliDropship team. Their expert team created unique ads like beautiful pictures, videos, texts, and so forth with detailed guides. When is the best time to post your ads on social media like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter? You can check with the social media Consumer Goods Engagement or keys data points provided by them. It is helpful, practical, and easy to understand.  I am a newbie to marketing and social media. Thus, I have to start learning new things and trying out new experiences.  Thank you, AliDropship, for giving me a chance to master my marketing and social media skills. I am still learning all skills now.The quality of work of AliDropship is meticulous, skillful, professional, and the rest. Furthermore, I appreciate their team has been supporting me at all times.  The support team is one of the most open-minded people I have ever met, with awareness, conscientiousness, alertness, etc. In addition, if you are interested in the e-commerce business.

Their team checked out my server configuration and tried to figure out what could possibly be going wrong with it and after a few days I had it up and running. I tried other plugins, but the other plugins didn't have hardly any features as compared to this one. We're trying to have hundreds of products that we dropship and this plug-in is the only possible way to do that efficiently. The automatic price adjustment and the settings made it way easier for pricing items loaded on the site, and it's nice to know that as product prices change on AliExpress, they also get updated on my store.

After the purchase IREN said that from now on she will transfer me to someone who is professional who will manage the whole process from A-Z and so I received an email from LARISA OGUTSOVA who introduced herself and we started working. With all my experience in all the media there is I have never met a person like her with a lot of patience and knowledge accompanied me until the store went live and so I decided to buy a second store and it is only thanks to her.

3,NOT A SCAM - but not for me!,"[UPDATE] I ordered my own Premium business, and cancelled the next day. The owner asked why I’m the first to write a 1⭐️ Review without even using the service, but still gave a FULL REFUND! For that reason I have to tread carefully. I get it, who am I to write a review?I just believe I have a clearer view (having ordered my website) of what this really is.Picture this:There’s a successful website - drop-shipping products. They copy & paste that website and sell it to the public. Your copy is made to look like an established business, and each product has brilliant 5 star reviews. I imagine these are selected reviews (arranged in a nice order for you) from their own successful stores. Is that genuine? That may be the nature of marketing (manipulating truth by boosting only the GOOD) - but it’s a little shifty to me.CONCLUSION: This website seems from this inside out - very genuine. The way I see it, you could probably (who knows!) make a few bucks via one of their websites with enough marketing.I also believe the person who runs this has integrity and wants to help people make a living! But I don’t believe in the vision of faking success to make success. And that’s what you and I would have to do.Thank you for the refund. But this is not for me. If anything, it would inspire me to do what the people at the top are doing. Start your own website from the ground up, and try and find good products that sell.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

I have sent a few emails to support@alidropship 17 hours ago, until now I haven't received I single response and I still can't access my alidropship account as it still says site can't be reached. I have some Ads running directing them to my site that is now useless if one is using home wifi and could also have a negative impact on potential customers. 17hours not being able to access alidropship is long, this is my last resort of at least getting a resolution as I have exhausted the channel that I was meant to use to get in touch with them with no luck. I hope that this post doesn't get ignored as I genuinely need help in getting it back up. Initial review rating: 2Update: Mr. Yaros, reached out to me and dealt with my issue until it was fully resolved.

1,Alidropship team support is extremely poor and disappointing...,"I ventured into drop shipping in 2018 when I wanted to try ecommerce and ordered for 3 custom-built stores from Alidropship (English, French, and Spanish). It was a big investment and cost me thousands of GBP to set-up and maintain these stores.For two and half years, no single sale was made on these stores. Anytime I contacted Alidropship team on possible suggestions to get sales, all I was told is to buy more social media marketing tools/products from them, which I did. I kept on spending more with no result and no sale.All I can conclude is that Alidropship is only interested in making money from people by constantly asking them to spend on their custom-built stores and social medial marketing kit/products. Alidropship team does not go the extra mile to support those they have sold custom-built store or marketing products/tools/kits for and ensure these investments bring the needed sales to those investing on it. That is very disappointing and bad business/marketing ethics. That is why I am giving them one star",Alidropship,Trustpilot

Have spoken to 7-8 different people and while they are regular in their communication in the beginning, they simply become non responsive as days progress. Basically have no faith or trust in alidropship. Have also asked them to refund the money paid for the premium store, for which they start giving long explanations. Tired of their below average customer service. Will never recommend alidropship to anyone. Pathetic!If there was a half of negative star to the review, I would have chosen that.

3,The plugin itself is great but that was it for me,"Purchased a premium store with a few add-on's which I personally now think are way overpriced and quite generic. Bought the marketing package which is literally a pdf doc of some ads they ran previously for specific items (you might not even want to stock those items making the pdf pointless to me). Also bought the Installation Package which says they will give you 3 different domain names - they didn't - I had to come up with it myself. It also says they provide a logo - but it's actually just the generic logo they use on their branding but with your store name on it. I also paid for the social media package which I still haven't received/heard from in almost a month... I did reach out to Yaro before writing this because I don't like to go public but he didn't really address the issues at hand and simply redirected me back to my account manager. I'm still in the same position I was in when I emailed him. So overall I'd say the plugin is worth it, but they do try to sell themselves as a service but I don't think that's what it is. You will need to do a lot of work in the backend to make it your own really.",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,Very good Plugin,The Alidropship plugin one of the best in the market for WordPress/ Woocommerce,Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,All because…. I stumbled over Yaros on the internet! #CEO #ADS #AwesomeTeam,"Purchased a Custom Store with Hosting by Alidropship. My Project Manager was Anna Murzakova, whose patience I must have tested numerous times with my repetitive questioning and a few other hiccups I had my end! Anna was consistently responsive, helpful, enormously patient, courteous & polite.With regards to the store itself... I am extremely impressed with its layout & and everything else. Very professional yet friendly & approachable company to deal with. They are always uber keen & uber responsive. Their quick turnaround/replies/interactions are personalized and not automated like some companies. Nothing is too much trouble for them. They keep everything fresh, exciting and vibrant and more importantly up-to-date. Their ‘Knowledge Base’ articles are well written, easy to follow (especially for novices like myself!)  They appear to have EVERTHING covered! #TotallyAwesome  Watch out Anna (et al) I may purchase again!! #I'llBeBackkk! :D",Alidropship,Trustpilot

Not to mention all the training and information videos/blogs they offer for free. Thanks again AliDropShip for a 5star service",Alidropship,Trustpilot
2,Worst experience I have ever had with a…,"Worst experience I have ever had with a service. I paid 500 $ for a store that I had to rework from the scratch, Lots of problems poorly chosen products with 2 images max on each product with no description at all on 100 product! Plus the problems and the bad the design of the store it self. I got most of their plugins, I had problems with almost all of them but they were able to fix them except for 2 they haven't been able to fix them until that day. I bought some of the services they offer. some were good but the expensive ones were bad. To be precise the 200$ for the FB&IG ads were terrible, you can design better posts and get better images your self or literally you can hire someone on fiverr for friction of the price and they will still be able to do better work. I had written a review here before and they asked me to edit it as they will do their best to help me which that never happened so the right thing to do is write my honest review about them. At this point I don't need their help and they hit the last nail in the coffin with the FB&IG Ads and matter of the fact is I'm demanding a refund that will make things right for just this part. Counclosin Don't buy any services from them nor plugins maybe just main plugin itself and social rabbit the rest you can buy or even get for free on wordpress. Edit: Don't trust the reviews in here as they have a lot of fake reviews",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,Alidropship Review,"I purchased a supreme package for a site development and on the whole am quite happy with the finished product. There is some slight hands-on participation to the site development. As the site owner, I was given some questions, the answers of which helped shape and personalize the site development. The project was completed in just over a month's time which included the store development, the development of social media accounts, the Social Rabbit Plugin posting to the social media accounts, a short welcome video placed on the store front, an ad marketing package, email follow up for subscribers and buyers, blog posts and product uploads. I also later purchased additional add on plugins and which were installed. The project team created a clean family branding and took care of the little things like design of the company logo and image branding which individually done could take a lot of time and headaches, and handled all the technical details of setting up the store, script installations, write-ups, and marketing packages.The site script and the alidropship plugin are quite easy to navigate though there was a slight learning curve for operation and management since I was totally new to its environment and CMS dashboard. The project manager guided me with screenshots and I quickly learned how to make adjustments and changes to the site and how to operate it. Persons familiar with Wordpress Environment and content scripts would adjust quickly. At the handover of the completed project, I was given a completion booklet. The booklet is by no means a comprehensive guide or manual for operation though did contain useful introductory information and suggestions.  There is a library of articles for useful installations, management and marketing. Some of the information is incomplete. The article for installation of FB access login does not contain the information on the javascript that would be needed for the FB access Login to work. FB provides this information on their business page.  An actual Manual of the site script and plugin would be very useful. I tested the finished product for 2 months while tweaking the site, pricing, policies and testing advertisement. I found the social posts lacking in liveliness and uninteresting. The Social Rabbit Plugin did malfunction after sometime. It works well with the FB page, never posted to Pinterest, and after some weeks stopped posting to the IG page. In terms of site development, I rate the alidropship supreme package 5 stars, the team’s effort 5 stars, the alidropship plugin 5 stars, the finished product 5 stars, the social rabbit plugin 4 stars as it is a bit rigid. I feel the provision of a more comprehensive manual for operation and management would enhance the purchase and reduce the learning curve and need for technical support or after service support. The communications for support was good with some staff and lacking with others, possibly due to language issues.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

4,Smooth Experience so far...,"I ordered a Custom Made Store for my Niche. The transaction was smooth and the details were mailed quickly. The process was initiated within time and Basecamp was setup where you can see what activities are going on the development of your website. That part was quick. The team is accommodating and do not get hassled by revisions. They surely know what they are doing and deliver as per the process. Special mention of my support team member Ms Victoria Solov'ena. She is prompt, helpful, courteous and accommodating. The reason for not giving a 5 star rating to Alidropship would be a) Product Choices while importing can be improved as they are substandard and imported just for the sake of it and b) Designing work needs to be improved. Overall Satisfied so far. Will be exploring other services as well.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

4,Worth the investment,"I have been attempting to start an e-commerce site using the dropshipping model for some time now.I initially tried Shopify. I watched videos on youtube and read all the how-to build websites that I could. After a year of paying a monthly fee, I did not have a site.I just could not make sense of building a site. The name and the logo, setting up payment gateways.It was just overwhelming. Then I came upon the Alidropship site and ordered the advanced package.I figured why not I was wasting money with the Shopify fees and not doing anything with that site. I was so impressed when Elena B. and her team were done with my site. They did a great job.I did have a few issues. There where some products still showing images and text from the Aliexpress site.The fact is, I am now the owner of this site and need to learn how to resolve these issues. Running an e-commerce sit is not as easy as all those videos you see on youtube and elsewhere. As far as what I think about Alidropship. Elena B. and her team did a great job. I have a functioning site. After I get some more experience in running this site I will not hesitate to come back to Alidropship and have a second store built.So thank You Alidropship team.

And you want to make sure you receive the help you paid for. I just want to start by saying Thank You Ksenia Sorokopud! and her Team!!  Now to give an honest review, I started with great excitement, to find a group of people that would take my ideas of what I wanted and create it for me.  It seemed at first that nothing was getting done. And I felt like I was a bother, and started trying to do things because I thought that was what I was supposed to do. (it was very confusing). I did have a deadline to reach that I did not, the logo I have is not the logo I had in mind for my business. I purchased things I did not need to purchase thinking that's why it was listed and sent to me. Eventually, we were on the same page during the end I began to understand what was taking place and had more of an understanding of the process of creating it. I like the look of my page. I had no idea how the mechanic of it to process an actual order. There are many youtube videos that I was able to review. I am very pleased to continue communication with Ksenia for help, or just to run things past her and I greatly appreciate her that.  I think more work should go into explaining to customers what will happen, what comes with the packet.  Customers can be advised on things but the ultimate choice belongs to the Business Owner.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

The package claims, they will provide premium domain Name, however, it's not so.4. you will be allowed only one revision for most of the work shown to you, so decide within on revision.5.

5,I am very happy with my custom store!,"I am very happy with my custom store purchased from these folks. I had a quick read of some of the bad reviews on here and personally I don't really understand them. If you want to earn a LOT of money drop shipping, AliDropship is your place to start. However, once your store is set up you need to actually do more work if you want to earn real money. Reading some of the negative reviews I feel like a lot of those customers just want to lay in bed all day and wake up to a $5000 a month business with no work. IT TAKES WORK once it's set up.AliDropship do a wonderful job setting you up but after that you need to knuckle down and do the work yourself, add new products, rewrite descriptions, research marketing, learn SEO, it takes work to get the money in just like any other business out there.If you want a drop shipping business I would recommend using these folks as personally I had a wonderful experience and I am very happy with my custom store but now I am working on it every day!All you have to remember is that once your store is set up, get ready to do the hard yards if you want to start bringing in the big $$$$$",Alidropship,Trustpilot

5,Awesome companny.,"I left review 10 hours ago inthe middle of the night and I got full refund for even non refundable purchases. I told the ceo that cancel all the license keys but he provided lifetime free store and all the services and refunded me in full. Now I got free premium store, free marketing package and full refund of 455 USD in 10 hours time. Apart from this, CEO has fixed some of the technical bugs about price changing formula and he is now handling to resolve all the issues of my website. The following is the previous version of review just for your refference which is not at all true anymore : Scammer, Scammer. I dont want to waste my precious time on this company so I'm copying and pasting an email which I just sent to their CEO. Here it goes, consider it as my trustpilot review : I spent around 600 USD or even more in your company and long story short, I'm not satisfied as all the service and material are crap. If you want I can elaborate my issue.Let me do that,I purchased premium dropshipping store and what I was found is your automated price changin tool is not changing price of all the 116 items but only aprox 80% of the item,What response I got from your support is due to FB designed o layout which has no relationThey changed the prices with my permision then says if you want the same price again then you'll have to reinstall the store because resetting the price will disturb prosuct page layout which is desigmed for FB ads.After complete dis satisfaction I talked to your manager on whatsapp supporn number, they refused to refund instead provided me solution to buy marketing package.With some hope I purchased marketing package and 😡😡😡😡 I got third grade 2 MB per video ads with video clarrity of 20 years old cameras.The extremely disappointin experience was the marketin part.Afterwards I wa pithed different plugins and services to generate sales and I purchased the plugins amd serviesTo be honest I dont have issue with plugins but again, servies of adding import items with product page package is the recent unsatisfactory experiences.They thought I'm a fool and simply provided me 3rd grade product page seriously just by clicking on import button and publoshing live on my websiteIt looks terrible hey.Please cancel all my subscriptions, cancel all the alideopship license keys and refund my money.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

5,Hello everyone,"Hello everyone I just wanted to leave a quick post about one of the many positive experiences I've had with AliDrophip.This morning I was looking over my store and feeling kinda bummed out and I posted something about my frustrations and how I was not making any sales and felt as though I was not receiving the help I should have been. Well, I just wanted everyone to know after I posted my post I received a message about 20 min later from Yaros the CEO of AliDropship regarding my bad experience. In my books that is someone who cares about customer satisfaction. Not only did we work through my issue (which turned out to be a lack of information on my side) but he also set me up with a few extra perks to help my store. Before buying my store I read so many positive reviews and very few negative ones (Honestly I was a bit skeptical) I now know why there were so few negative reviews? For the CEO of any company to contact their customers directly is unheard of and to me, this shows how important their customers are. I just wanted everyone who is considering buying or already owns a store that AliDropship is the best decision you will ever make to dropship. They are a 5 Star+ company and I'm very happy I chose them over Shopify. Thank You Yaros, Victoria, Elena, and the AliDropship team.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

5,My way to success with Dropshipping with AliDropship,"MY story about AliDropship was started in 2018 when I search to find how to start dropshipping business. I found one company which have 8000+ suppliers in data base. But when I look to created website, I see that I need do all on my own. That’s not good for the first time. I search for how to do and what write about all what you need, I didn’t find what I was looking for and so 16 months go around and then I find AliDropship. Then I go to search all website what they have, read blog and success stories and this take me 3 weeks. After that I thinking around 3-4 days to do or not to do and  I couldn’t decided how to started with just plugin & guide to build on my own my first e-store or buy custom store. It took me 2-3 days for thinking about ON MY OWN or CUSTOM STORE. After 3 days I decided to take custom store to see how need to be created e-store and what write. When I waiting I go look again who is the manager for custom store and I wish that I want Helen Gurneva to be my project manager. When coming first msg to me, I didn’t believed that my wish came true. Yeeaaah.I decided to take time for creation my first E-commerce, because I want really good store and I don’t care about days how fast they can created E-store when the have all your wishes which you want. Then we start little by little creation my e-store. I described everything in detail how I want my E-commerce to be. We work few days and then came holidays and I have 6-7 days to thinking how all be look, then I can provided all information to Helen and her team. And time go so fast that I get my e-store on 28.01.2020 and I not finished yet, because I have time to do everything about website now when I have time to do slowly and perfect. When I came to the creation my e-store on Facebook, I created. But when I want created automation update prices and add new product(s) to my FB store when I updated price(s) of product(s) or add new product(s), I came to Facebook Pixel. I created pixel and created events but when I followed that I need micro data in my website and I checked this with tool which was in guide. Then I see I need fixed this micro data and all. When I followed some guide how to fixed this to the line. I destroyed my first good e-store, I was nervous and ask myself how to fixed. I didn’t know what to do. I go contacted my hosting provider and ask if my hosting server has automation backup. When agent tell me that I don’t have automation backup, I was right at the bottom of bottom. I ask what can I do. Agent take time to find solution how to help me and find that I need buy restoration hosting would cost me 182.99 €. What??? Then I decide to contacted Helen and explain what I do and ask if she has backup for my website. She tell me that will be look if has and after 6-7 hours she contacted me and ask me for details which she needed and she amazing fast save me and save my money. Now I have a few work to do to finished my first e-store. When I finished I will start put my SEO formula to my website. Which will be bring in 3-4 months 20 000+ visitors without spending any money and put some ads on different social media and website, that will be boom. I know that and this is reason why I working slowly and perfect. Because I will be have a lot of work with put new products and so on.I very recommended AliDropship, because they have amazing people which do exactly how you wish to do. If you don’t have time to work with amazing people and want started NOW with dropshipping, you can buy establish store and get ready store which do profits already.Thank you for Helen to help me, advice me, gave me opinions which I needed and her amazing team which to perfect job for me and will be soon.Matjaz Dobaja (Founder & Owner of Happy Residency)",Alidropship,Trustpilot

It’s a great tool that import products, variations, reviews, prices, fulfilling orders automatically, pricing automation and many more. So instead of building your website and waist your time importing products and pictures manually or fulfilling orders manually you can just buy Alidropship plugin once for a lifetime! No monthly fees!Also, it took my attention the way they support their customers, when you subscribe to their newsletters, they send you daily emails that help you improve your business, especially when they lately introduced the AliDropship insights that help dropshippers exploring new niches and what’s trending in different countries.This plugin really helped me improve my website and my workflow, looking forward to buy more products that will help me increase my sales! :D",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,I would recommend Custom Store Service,"Without any doubts, I would recommend Custom Store Service at Alidropship.

(my niche is kids clothes).",Alidropship,Trustpilot
4,Overall Good Plugin,"First of all, the good - So far from my experience, Olika is one of the best support officers that I have ever come across in terms of technical and people skills. Most of the times, you can trust her to come up with good advice and solutions for your  issues. Secondly,the plugin is good with useful features and they seem to have better developers compared to some other companies.Some concerns - As I stated earlier, the plugin is good but it can be improved, for example , the feature to add individual reviews from aliexpress one by one from the aliexpress product page can be incorporated into the plugin.Sometimes they can take some time to respond to your query and few of the other support staff can improve with some more training. However, keep in mind fast response is no good if the response is not good.Overall, alidropship woo is a very good package. Its well worth trying, compared to other popular alternatives",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,Why not give it a try,"In their policy said 30 days refund, they actually kept their words, I got back my refund without problem and they always try to help you. It worths a try because if you change your mind within 30days, you can get back your money.",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,EXCELLENT,"EXCELLENT. From start to finish, my store was built by an amazing, professional team and the finished result is VERY professional! Without a doubt, I would highly recommend. Thanks to my Manager, Tatiana, whose response time to any questions I had was fast and detailed. Do not hesitate to use Alidropship to build your store!",Alidropship,Trustpilot
3,"Good CEO, plugins are good but can be better!","Edit: I decided to edit my review due to the issue was resolved. But I still have to write a fair review.Initially, I had issues with the plugin and I raised my issues on the live chat the support team did not respond for days. Thereafter, once I wrote my review here and the CEO Yaros stepped in to resolve my issue when I contacted him personally. I was or I should say I am still glad he stepped in to resolve my issues. However, I am not pleased with his support team who were not providing helpful response when the bug was indeed there previously. Time were wasted, and days passed when I had to troubleshoot on my own. As mentioned again, luckily things were resolved, really thankful to Yaros. I am not sure about him, but I personally feel for him for having such team. His support team is the problem for review ""The CEO is there to listen to my chat complaints on the issues quietly, resolving the issues for me WITHOUT ANY single bad attitude, things are moving thanks to him. It does not concern me much about the behind scene whether he is a bad or good boss not. But I ONLY know he had helped me which I can see, read from our chat conversation. This is the reason why I had decided to edit my review.Last but not least, the plugins are only good for Aliexpress. If they had other suppliers added in, or google merchant working with other suppliers, it will be nice but they wouldn't be called Alidropship if that's the case. Their plugins definitely has room of further improvement!",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,Alidropship Custom Store Recommendation,"I bought a custom store from Alidropship and i am in the process of completing it, hopefully in a couple of days. The team has some good systems in place where in you are able to track the progress of the store and also provide feedback. I did run into a couple of issues and was not getting the support i wanted from my project manager. However the CEO Mr.Yaroslav stepped in himself and sorted out the issues.

I plan to buy another store from Alidropship soon.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

He also always responded in a very short time, which was a very important aspect for me, because I work full time in a very responsible position.I experienced the whole team as very professional. Requests were implemented within a very short time and it has become clear that it is important for them as a team to make me a happy customer.

5,Top 7 Reasons Why You Must Try AliDropship!,"I was in search of a team which could help me in getting started with the world of Dropshipping and I happen to stumble across AliDropship team.After a little bit of research about their company and services, I purchased their ""Ultimate Custom Store"" package.Upon purchase, I was immediately assigned with a project manager (Ms Elena Baranova) and was given access to Basecamp, their project management and team communication tool.After the initial rounds of introduction, we got started with the project.Here's what impressed me about the process1. Good and prompt communication (through Skype)2. Sound Knowledge about the field.3. They have an amazing support team and they always respond well within time.4. They have amazing self-help blogs/guides which really is handy and is extremely well written and easy to understand.5. All the people with whom I had interacted were extremely polite.6. Suggestions and recommendations given were very helpful.7. Good for people who want some hand-holding.I also went ahead and purchased all their paid add-ons and their elite version of their product database.In conclusion, they appear to be 100% genuine, more customer-centric and not just sales/profit-driven.

They designed the site to exactly how I wanted, and having the initial questionnaire to fill out the base answers for the site was great. Made things so easy. TIP: Do not go in and start doing things until they say it’s ok.

Specifically critical decisions like the more convenient theme to choose for my type of store as well as help in refining my product niche. Where issues or challenges arose, she was very proactive and always had various alternatives available for me to choose from and this allowed me to be able to make informed decisions. I also found her advise around third party payment solutions extremely helpful in navigating something that is very daunting for me. Also her patience in explaining any concepts that were foreign to me is commendable. I'm extremely happy with the look and theme of my store, as well as nuances added by the team to it that communicate trust to the consumer. It's been an exciting introduction for me into e-commerce with AliDropship.

4,"A harrowing experience to start, but the CEO is a legend!","This initially was one of the worst experience of my life. The project had gone over by two weeks, and was then closed, incomplete! But after all my issues and set backs, CEO Yaros was kind enough to take the time out himself to resolve the situation, and I will be working with the team again in the future.Sales do butter it up like the perfect package, but as with all sales, it's mainly rubbish, half of the things I was told I would get were not included, or you have to pay more for, or the team just outright refuse to do, even if it is as clear as day there in the package. I would be sure to read everything IN DETAIL before signing up for any package. As a simple, quick shop fix, for a store you need instantly, and if you don't really care about the content, this is PERFECT for you. But if, like myself, you have a detailed idea and specific style and level of quality for the products and store, then it is most definitely better to go it alone.As far as systems go though, the plugin is pretty good, I would recommend going for the Woo plugin over the basic though, it has a lot of scope for future development and expansion as you learn the industry more. As with the original you are tied exclusively in to Aliexpress, but with woo you have another entire platform to expand your store in the future.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

1,The plugin idea is great but only one…,"The plugin idea is great but only one star because when you chat with them for a issue or anything else, you will only receive one answer per day, a shame. If there’s a Livechat it’s not for waiting an answer like emails.. And if you’ve any issue with the plugin it will shutdown your business for many days because they take their time, I don’t think they care a lot about their customer issue. At this time I’m very disappointed. Only many thanks to Yaros who reply faster (by email) than the customer service on the Livechat!",Alidropship,Trustpilot
4,I only give 3 stars because the idea of…,"UPDATE :The support team was very fast to reply after seeing my review. I guess it was my mistake and that I oversaw certain things, however,they are very rude in replying and making me understand that. Not very friendly.I only give 3 stars because the idea of this plugin is great and affordable. However, the service has been very slow and the Project Manager ( who in my case was Tatiana ) is very slow in replying to queries.  Although certain tasks were ticked as done on Basecamp, I HAD TO DO the transactional email service configuration. They promise to do everything and give you a fully functional site which is ready to sell. This was part of the deal.I am not very tech savvy so I do not know what kind of issues my site might still have. I got my website audited by a professional who is a friend and he said that my robots.txt file forbids search engines to crawl my website and that this will affect my SEO in a massive way. I was on the verge of starting a Google Ads campaign and thank God I got this report before that! Now before someone tells me that this is something I will have to do myself and it is not part of the package, this is coding, which is technical support you're supposed to be giving. all I expected was someone to at least inform me about such things, since you guys developed the website.I was told that Meta data, Google indexing, social bookmarking will be done as on site SEO for my site. I am not sure if this was even done at this point.I am absolutely appalled and disappointed with the service",Alidropship,Trustpilot

5,Money Well Spent!,"Hi Everyone,To Anyone who is thinking of taking up the option of having a site ""professionally"" created for you, read this first and learn about my experiences and what you can expect. Getting a site professionally done was my first time so I didnt know what to expect. My project manager was extremely cool. She had her finger on the pulse from the word go! I came into this project with all kinds of ideas I had learned from marketing courses, but after a couple of days I settled down and focused on getting the site built, which is the most important thing when doing business online, you have to have your site built and finished before you can put your ideas for business into action.When you do this - and believe me it is far easier to let people who know what they are doing to handle this aspect of business, than for you to try and learn and do it all yourself. They are skilled at this and will do it correctly from the beginning, if you do things yourself and then ask for their services in other areas, they will give you suggestions you have to change ""first"" before you can implement the services they do for you, and it isn't because they are trying to rip you off, it is because they want you to succeed and put you in the best position possible, so save yourself - like I did - a whole lot of wasting time and efforts and get them to create the site for you. When you see the Finished result like I did you will know in your heart you made the right choice to hire them, I would have went through more wasted time learning, but they know what they are doing and do it fast, with precision and properly.I am not here to show off my web design skills, I am in business and one of many things I know; it is better to hire professionals to do something for you so you can get on to making money, hire them to do this for you like I did - I ordered the advanced package, and will add to my site with product packages - so you save time and can get on to making money. The longer you take to get up and running and providing people with your stuff the longer people have to suffer with mediocre services being presented to them. This service will make you look like the belle of the ball among ugly sisters, and when your visitors hit your site, they will be strongly encouraged to buy because of the professional site the have landed on.Hire them, even if you have to save to pay for their services - I saved for about a month so I could afford their services, and it was all well worth it.Their services offered are highly skilled, very professional and patient, and the results you receive are top shelf. Get it!Stephen",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,"Customer Support was bad, but Yaros contacted me and resolved everything very quickly!","UPDATE: Yaros contacted me and he fixed it very fast, in couple of hours.At the moment I have to use php 7.2, as Yaros explained the alidropship is compatible with php 7.3, but the necessary plugin for it - IonCube Loader, right now is not very compatible with php 7.3. He said he will test some things and will let me know as soon as php 7.3 is available. Plugin is great and Yaros also, but customer support not so much.1. Customer support answers once a day, even if they are online they will simply ignore you till next day to waste more time of you.2. They asked my wp-admin and cpanel details, after looking into it they said it is not their problem that my site experiences error 500 as soon as I activate their plugin. They said it is my problem with my host and offered me their ""Service Configuration"" service for 40$ an hour or to switch from my SG host to their Hosting servers.3. I contacted SiteGround before contacting alidropship and they debugged and analysed the error and it was coming from alidropship.4. After I wrote SiteGround's response to alidropship regarding error 500. Alidropship support went against themselves and said the following: ""We have lots of clients with SiteGround and without 500 error, so I guess issue with your account settings.""This all happened after I updated my php 7.1 to 7.3 for faster website. And Alidropship states that it is compatible with php 7.3 so It must work. My ecommerce website is down already for 7 days and will be at least for a day more, because they answer once every day, however I have started to doubt that they will do anything as they simply try to shrug me off and point their issues at everyone else, and sell their services.",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,"The Customer Service Team is Lazy with Zero Technical Knowledge but Yaros, the CEO Came to the Rescue!","The Alidropship business  model in it's entirety is a good one, but with one major problem - The people interfacing with customers! My experience with the customer service team has so far been nothing but BAD! I bought the Plugin a couple weeks back, downloaded the plugin alongside one of the Free themes. Being a developer myself, I proceeded to setup the plugin and store myself and while things went smoothly for the most part, I encountered some issues along the way. Some of these issues were: 1) I noticed that the integrated payment gateway, specifically Stripe wasn't working as expected. 2) I noticed that the Currency switching on the front page of the site wasn't working properly. 3) I also noticed that one of the Payment complete pages of the plugin was returning a 404 Error not found.I contacted AliDropship with my complaint and after a couple days, I got the following response from Vladimir: ( Hi there,I have tied to proceed a test purchase, and it didn't went through, it didn't even took the money from the card, I would recommend to contact stripe for clarification .Best regards,Vladimir)The annoying part of this response was that, it was clear that the guy in question had NO SINGLE technical knowledge, so he just went ahead to put the blame on Stripe. I responded and told him that the issue was not from Stripe, and also showed him proof that the card was actually charged. I again pointed out to them that the issue was from their plugin. I didn't hear from Vladimir again after then. Since he didn't know what else to do and noticed that he was wrong, he simply ignored me. Days later, I followed up again and told them my issue was still not resolved and told them that I would ask for a full refund, if they couldn't fix the issue. After about 18hrs, I finally received a response from Alidropship, but this time, from another agent, Victoria!She said she had transferred the issue to the developers and that she will let me know, once she has a response. Days later, I followed up again and she responded with the message below: (Hello!Thank you for your waiting!The developer has checked the issue with our test keys for Stripe, we have same issue. So your Stripe account set up correctly.But you have issue from the hosting/server side. All your session can't be safe and it's the reason why after payment site redirect you to Home page.Could you please connect with your hosting support and ask them to check the settings.)Again, another Support team member had shifted blame to my hosting. She even went as far as trying to sell me their personal hosting packages. As a developer, I knew that again, her conclusion was wrong, it had nothing to do with my hosting! As a matter of fact, my hosting was much more secured and faster than what they had to offer. At that point, I decided to look for alternative Drop-shipping service providers but in the process, after two days, there was an update to their Plugin and after I updated the plugin, like magic, the Stripe payment bug issues disappeared and payment started working fine. I reached out and pointed this out to Victoria, that after the update on their plugin, the issue disappeared and that was a clear evidence that it had nothing to do with Stripe, nor my hosting but the issue was from their Plugin.I have now reached out to the team again with the other complaints especially with respect to the 404 error payment complete page generated by the Plugin and once again, without investigating in anyway, Irene from Alidropship have shifted the cause of the issue again to Stripe, claiming that I was using Stripe test keys for the site and that was why, I was having issues. Although I knew that this was wrong, I went ahead to to change the keys to STRIPE LIVE KEYS and the problem still persisted. Again, Irene has gone mute or have simply ignored me. I think that Alidropship's biggest problem lies with their customer service team which has ZERO technical knowledge, patience and skills whatsoever. If you for any reason have to resolve a technical issue with these guys, you will be frusutrated. This is my personal experience.UPDATE - 27th September, 2019I had to update my rating because it seems like the best and honest thing to do after the CEO of AliDropship, Mr. Yaros reached out personally and did his very best to resolve the issues. As it turned out, the bug was attributed to a session file in the AliDropship plugin and Yaros apologised on behalf of his team, quickly resolved the issue and also went ahead to thank me for providing insights and helpful information that would help make the Plugin better. I cannot ask for a better service than this, and therefore, I have now reviewed my initial review from a 1 star to 5 stars! Like I stated earlier, the AliDropship is a great Plugin, probably one of the best in the market for now, but if for any reason you come across any issues with the support reps like I did in the process of setting up your store; Ask to be connected to Yaros, the CEO. He's the one from my experience with the technical expertise and patience to properly resolve your issues. After-al, they say, it's the owner of the business that know it's worth. Thank you again Yaros!",Alidropship,Trustpilot

5,I bought a custom Supreme package store…,"I bought a custom Supreme package store with 500 products added. The good experience has begun here. I was met by Sergei, and very well attended!This was on August 29, 2019, and by the 30th I was already in contact with my manager Anastasiya Sergeeva.We exchanged a hundred messages on Skype and the store was being modeled. All fast and correct.After being added to Basecamp, I was able to relate to more people on the team (Diana, Yana - they had the most contact with me), but I know the team is huge and thank you all for your commitment and dedication.Not everything they can do on their own, some things we have to do ourselves, and I recognize that some people will have more difficulties than others. As I understand a little digital marketing, for me it was easier to perform.Today 25/09/2019 - 19 business days later, the store was delivered to me and fully functional.Thank you very much to all the staff who worked on it and congratulations for the excellent work!Now comes the fun part.

5,Outstanding Technical Support,"I would like to start by sharing that I am not a Technical person.  And that I don't have extensive computer skills.  The Knowledgebase has been a terrific source of information and has been able to help get me started in the right direction.  From Editing a particular theme to Transferring from 3rd party Hosting to AlidropShip Hosting. And if I haven't been able to find the answers I've reached out via the chatbox on that particular page.  I recently had the pleasure of dealing with Sergey in Technical support. I had a problem that I just couldn't work out, but with patience and kindness not only was I able to work through the problem, and able to learn.  And this is all thanks to the outstanding service provided by Sergey.  He went above and beyond what I expected.  He took the time to help me learn and work through my problem. A Massive thank you to Sergey. I am so very thankful for such a positive experience.  I believe if you are open and willing to learn and ask help, help will be given. Just don't be afraid to ask for help.  I highly recommend AlidropShip to anyone seeking to get involved with DropShipping.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

1,most PAINFUL experience,"Dear Reader,This review should be one of the most honest, practical, and recent experience I had with AliDropship.Important things to keep in mind before making your purchase of a customized online store from AliDropship:1. Terms of Service: Read it! They offer ZERO refund if the project after completion was not as satisfactory for you as they promise or described in the packages page:2. Communication: They use  SKYPE not for voice/video calls but for texting to hold you accountable for the mess they are creating for you.   2.1 Basecamp: They use this tool as they claim to keep you          informed of all the steps being completed, however, once you          visit the main web page of the Basecamp, the only feeling you          will have is feeling LOST and saying "" What the heck am I          doing here"". Its just a total mess. Its totally useless and          ineffective    2.2 The account manager ""Anastasiya"" was either a basic English          speaker or she doesn't really care about what I wanted as she          only cared about fishing the project not matter with the cost          was and ignored my important concerns not matter how many          times I repeated it for her. She will be probably your account          manager from hell.   2.3 After the third week their CEO ""Yaros"" accepted to change          her and sent the senior manager ""Alena"" of my account          manager ""Anastasiya"". The surprise is that ""Alena"" instead of          solving my issue she was totally over the moon knowing          nothing about my case and my issue, she started to defend         ""Anastasiya"" claiming she is the best account manager and          that all customers are liking her so why am satisfied wit her!!!          Although I showed her the evidence screenshots that there is          a problem in the completion of the project and that its          incomplete and not as described in the package delivery page         she ironically ignored all of this and claimed saying ""No! The          project is done and ready to transfer to you"". Guess What! I          simply blocked her :)3. ZERO work: They claim that you will do nothing or any type of effort. its  a BIG LIE! ""Anastasiya"" will bombard you with forms to fill out and long articles to read. In such forms you will be asked wide open questions like, how you want your website to look like?! Seriously! How to answer such a question when the website will contain many different colors and sections/pages, they leave you with a small text box to explain a very tiresome questions that cant be answered. 4. Customized website: They claim that the website will look they you want. Its a BIG LIE! The items menu was not arranged according to the alphabetical order, yet random. I asked her ""Anastasiya"" to arrange it according to the alphabetical order, she replied "" Sorry! our developers said they cant do it"" Its the funnies most ironic reply I heard from an IT tech company. The themes they offer are very limited and not creative its just a copycat job.   4.1 Website Logo: They claim to design a special website logo for         you, but guess what ! Its way far from being special, Its stolen         indeed. When I checked the logo they designed for on google,         I was shocked to see the same logo but the only thing they did         was changing the color! Plus its the worst quality you will ever         have and you can do better than it by yourself.5. Website: Upon the completion of the website you will notice that few logos are displayed on your website like ""Godaddy.com"" logo! And when I asked her why or whats the reason, she replied its has nothing to with ""GoDaddy"" its just for marketing purposes! So it was to deceive people. 6. Refund: After AliDropship was not being able to complete the order as agreed and did not give any effective solution. I asked for a full refund! Guess What! I got a full refund after ""Alena's"" refusal to do so. How did I convince them to refund me although they don't do refunds at all ! I used my ways :)7. Your Rights: You will not find on their website what privileges you have or what are the permissible things to ask for. When I asked to change some of the products they choose for me, ""Anastasiya"" said you are only allowed to ask for a change five times only!  I was not able to find where these right were.**Summary** It was the most painful, tiresome, mentally exhausting, unpleasant and unprofessional experience I've ever had on the internet. If after reading this detailed review, you are still unconvinced and wants to take the risk, I advice you to buy the basic package it will cost you around  317 USD. Dont risk for more than that amount.Regards,",Alidropship,Trustpilot

5,Amazing experience with AliDropship custom store!,"I did a lot of research on drop shipping (AliDropship vs Shopify) and watched many YouTube videos for months. I read good and bad reviews about AliDropship plugin and their custom store.On 25 June, I decided to buy an ultimate custom store. It was one of the best decisions I made this year! I received an email from my project manager, Anna Murzakova next day. Initially, the whole process was a bit overwhelming i.e. Basecamp and a lot of questions to answer in Sheets. I couldn’t download the Skype to my Mac. So I emailed Anna with my answers. She was so good that she gave me sound advice with easy to understand explanation. Anna helped me choose the right niche for my interest. The designer, Anastasia, designed a beautiful logo for my website, the other team members worked hard behind the scenes. I loved the end result of my first store!     I was very impressed with Anna’s excellent customer care and support throughout the project. I bought another custom store and appointed her to be my project manager on my order form on 23 July.I know my future self will thank me for the decision I made that day ;)",Alidropship,Trustpilot

5,AliDropship Cares About Their Customers,"So I'm new to webdesign and a bit intimidated by the whole thing.

I was struggling to get the plugin installed properly so I sent him an email thinking he may get someone to assist me. Within a couple hours I got an email back from him personally, explaining how to proceed. WHAT CEO HAS TIME TO DO THAT? This guy is amazing! I highly recommend AliDropship for this very reason!

1,"Weak plugin, weak owner, low quality= ALIDROPSHIP","DEAR owner of lousy Alisdropshipyour plugin is weak, my website does not work , your services are inferior, and theft has been committed with your low quality company. I want o know why you have time to have false review made but no time to improve your disastrous company. is it too much to ask for a working website, with add ons? is to too much to ask for a quality plugin? perhaps it is too much for you to handle, I just hoped after paying well over TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS you might be able to do your job as owner and fix your backward products. oh well... I keep forgetting good company are run buy smart people with a business mindset ...My complaints against ALIDROPSHIP are as followed ( I have not been paid like for my review) :WEBSITE dose NOT WorkPLUGINS  are USELESS and do NOT workADD ONS do NOT work FALSE ADVERTISMNETHORRIBLE customer service  I believe these reviews with FIVE stars are from others sources ( most likely owner/ employees/ affiliates) MUST BE NICE TO GET PAID FOR EXCELLENT REVIEWS. Be careful with Companies like Alidropship. Reach out to me if you to have fallen victim to this company. I am keeping track and documentation of everything to pursue further actions. What alidropship has done is illegal False Advertisement is NOT okay! I am you can find me reviews against this company on various sites and I will continue to keep my reviews updated so others do suffer with the lost of money from ALIDROPSHIP. Please, if anyone has questions and wants to know the full experience of Alidropship then feel free to reach out to me. WARNING: Beware the fake reviews, I made the same MISTAKE, I thought I was smart looking through reviews before I made my purchase. I wish I had someone who had offered me the chance to find out more about what goes on after you hand over your hard earned money to ALIDROPSHIP. I feel ashamed that I did NOT do my proper research, but what matters to me now is that NO one gets involved with Alidropship without knowing the true story! Alidropship is WRONG for what they are doing and companies like this need to be exposed for the disgusting behavior and trickery. One star is too generous for Alidropship!  My WEBSITE dose NOT work, My add ons have not been installed after I paid my money ( ILLEGAL), and the PLUG IN is by far one of the BIGGEST problems!  I have been refused service, ( company REFUSES to respond to my on emails,skype, phone calls, ""life long support"" False, along with not completing the work which I paid ALIDROPSHIP  for.  I was forced into buying more add ons because ALIDROPSHIP refused to install my original add ons(cost me over $100 dollars). LOW QUALITY  banner( not surprised it is ALIDROPSHIPS STYLE) ALIDROPSHIP could NOT even handle the simple task of SOCIAL RABBIT, I have spent well over TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS and in return I was given a website that does NOT work properly.  I promise you will get ZERO support! ZERO results, and GARBAGE PLUGIN. I could go on and on about Alidropship and it's horrid PLUG IN ect,  but I will stop here. If you have questions about my experience, what I am currently going through to fight against this Horrible Alidropship company then reach out to me. I do NOT want to see anyone suffer because he or she did not have the real inside to this company FALSE ADVERTISMNET and LOW QUALITY PLUG IN. this company ALIDROPSHIP should feel ashamed for trying to fool people into butting there inferior products, website, and plug in. reach out to me if want more information. As of this Time July 21,2019 I have still NOT received services I paid for. It has been almost two months! I do NOT believe ALIDROPSHIP has any intentsion to fulfill my order, and fix their errors.

And I would like to share my opinion on both platforms: if you are deciding between Shopify+Oberlo and WooCommerce+AliDropship – I would say Shopify is easier to get started but it’s more expensive to run. With WooCommerce+Alidropship you’ll get much more flexibility in terms of customization such as the styling and appearance of the website. If you’re already well versed with WordPress so it’s not hard for you to use. Plus WooCommerce+Alidropship is less expensive. Moreover, Alidropship offers you two plugins for one price (WordPress and WooCommerce versions), so you can choose, it has a lot of free addons and free themes which you can try. Good luck!",Alidropship,Trustpilot

It’s not AliDropship problem, it’s a problem of AliExpress. Actually, this was resolved by the negotiation with supplier, with a free replacement and bonus gifts for the trouble. But I so happy AliDropship improve their software and try to solve even this problem with Aliexpress suppliers! The recent AliDropship update has an eddited product base so I hope they also will pick only good suppliers for the base which can help dropshippers avoid bad situation in the future. Thanks, team!There are some negative reviews on here for AliDropship, but many of them seem to be about individual shops rather than AliDropship as a whole. AliDropship is about dropshipping business and as all businesses it needs more that plugin installing or store building. It’s hard work.",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,About my dropshipping business,"When I was searching information about the dropshipping business and the ways to make it easier and cheaper, a friend of mine has introduced me to AliDropship (he saw Yaros’s posts on forums). I’ve picked AliDropship for Woocommerce because it allows more flexibility. Besides, for a fashion-related store (I have accessories), it’s important to have a really unique look. Now, I am confident I made the right choice. Actually, I can't say anything about custom stores, I built a store by myself, picked and imported products which seemed good to me and ran promotion with the social rabbit tool. I had a first sale yesterday! And I really happy! Highly recommend Alidropship plugin and promotion tools to all who want to start dropshipping",Alidropship,Trustpilot

5,my experience with a custom store and a plugin,"hey, want to share my experience with a custom store and a plugin. I had both options: ordered a custom store and built a store with the plugin by myself. In 2 weeks after my first custom store was made (I ordered basic package), I was able to reproduce from zero by my own. Win-win! Now I use one store for testing and one for selling. I can say that using the plugin is easier if you know how to work with WordPress. The custom store is even a better idea for newcomers because you get the results from specialists in this field and you save tons of hours of searching, testing, configuring, SEO and more… I liked both options, but as a preference, I would personally opt for a custom made store. Hope my review will be helpful for Trustpilot users",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,I had experience with a custom store…,"I had experience with a custom store and lucky me.. it was good. If you’re new in drop shipping business as was I it’d be better to order a custom store. You’ll chat with specialist, connect your wishes with reality and get a ready store. Actually, I didn’t chat, I wrote the big list of questions and send it to my manager. He contacted me in 2 days with the detailed answers and counter questions. The process of approving my requirements took about 1,5 weeks, it was ok for me as I want a perfect made store. After discussing all requirements, my manager sent me some designs for approval and finally i got my store after 3-3.5 weeks. I can say it was good experience or may be i was lucky and had a good manager. However, do not afraid ask questions and give your requirements. Good luck with your business!",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,2 stores with alidropship,"I have 2 stores with alidropship and the new update is amazing!

1,WARNING: FAKE ALIDROPSHIP  reviews posted to LURE people in BEWARE...,"My complaints against ALIDROPSHIP are as followed ( I have not been paid like for my review :WEBSITE dose NOT WorkPLUGINS  are USELESS and do NOT workADD ONS do NOT work NO SUPPORTFALSE ADVERTISMNETHORRIBLE customer service I have reached out to people who have given 5 star reviews and to a single one has responded. I believe these reviews with FIVE stars are from others sources ( most likely owner/ employees/ affiliates) MUST BE NICE TO GET PAID FOR EXCELLENT REVIEWS. Be careful with Companies like Alidropship. Reach out to me if you to have fallen victim to this company. I am keeping track and documentation of everything to pursue further actions. What alidropship has done is illegal False Advertisement is NOT okay! I am you can find me reviews against this company on various sites and I will continue to keep my reviews updated so others do suffer with the lost of money from ALIDROPSHIP. Please, if anyone has questions and wants to know the full experience of Alidropship then feel free to reach out to me. WARNING: Beware the fake reviews, I made the same MISTAKE, I thought I was smart looking through reviews before I made my purchase. I wish I had someone who had offered me the chance to find out more about what goes on after you hand over your hard earned money to ALIDROPSHIP. I feel ashamed that I did NOT do my proper research, but what matters to me now is that NO one gets involved with Alidropship without knowing the true story! Alidropship is WRONG for what they are doing and companies like this need to be exposed for the disgusting behavior and trickery. One star is too generous for Alidropship!  My WEBSITE dose NOT work, My add ons have not been installed after I paid my money ( ILLEGAL), and the PLUG IN is by far one of the BIGGEST problems!  I have been refused service, ( company REFUSES to respond to my on emails,skype, phone calls, ""life long support"" False, along with not completing the work which I paid ALIDROPSHIP  for.  I was forced into buying more add ons because ALIDROPSHIP refused to install my original add ons(cost me over $100 dollars). LOW QUALITY  banner( not surprised it is ALIDROPSHIPS STYLE) ALIDROPSHIP could NOT even handle the simple task of SOCIAL RABBIT, I have spent well over TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS and in return I was given a website that does NOT work properly.  I promise you will get ZERO support! ZERO results, and GARBAGE PLUGIN. I could go on and on about Alidropship and it’s horrid PLUG IN ect,  but I will stop here. If you have questions about my experience, what I am currently going through to fight against this Horrible Alidropship company then reach out to me. I do NOT want to see anyone suffer because he or she did not have the real inside to this company FALSE ADVERTISMNET and LOW QUALITY PLUG IN. this company ALIDROPSHIP should feel ashamed for trying to fool people into butting there inferior products, website, and plug in.",Alidropship,Trustpilot
1,AliDropship is a waste of your money!!!,"Alidropship completed my store in Feb 2019 and when I reviewed their work there were several changes that were not done to my instructions. The menus were in the wrong order, the Youtube channel image was cut off, several images were uploaded to the wrong category, the About page was not remotely consistent with the name of the site. It was a mess and it looked like no one was checking the work to ensure it was done properly. I brought this to their attention in Feb 2019 and it is now June 2019 and they still have not completed the changes I asked for. I also added Yaroslav Nesky the co-founder to the email so that he was aware of this and NOTHING! Don't waste your time with their lies. I still have not made a single sale from the site they built. Stay away!!!!",Alidropship,Trustpilot

4,"Good product, licensing is too tough and not user-friendly","Good product, licensing not goodAfter ordering, the licensing was not working so I changed my websites to Siteground. Then, it was working well and it is a great product. Even though, they made the licensing of Alidropship product too difficult so that, when you change something on your website (for example domain name), the product is not working anymore because it should be activated again (which did not work). I feel I bought a great car which I regularly can't open to drive with because the key is not reliable. This delays the creating of a website, just because of the Alidropship product. When they made the licensing not too tough, it sure is a great product.After working some time with the product, its okay. The support is good.Arnold",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,As a paying customer and a dropshipper,"As a paying customer and a dropshipper, with no other relationship with Alidropship (not part of their affiliate program, not getting paid to say this) I can say that yes, they are worthy of trust. I got tired of paying monthly fees but when I came across Alidropship, I got the freedom to dropship. The plugin has a one-time payment, the themes are free, add-ons are free, I import as many products as I want.I have two dropshipping stores. My first store on Alidropship was made on the Alidropship Woo plugin itself, later I changed it to Alidropship original (when I used WooCommerce and there are different order statuses like paid, processing, awaiting shipment, shipped, etc. which I have to do manually even this have nothing to do with Alidropship I suppose). Alidropship original is automatically updates all statuses. Btw as I’m dropshipping through aliexpress, honestly, I rarely have any problems with orders or suppliers. To all guys who interesting dropshipping business I highly recommend this plugin and company.",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,a quick review about the AliDropship Woo,"Hi, just a quick review about the AliDropship Woo plugin that I installed over the weekend. Five stars all the way. It's a well made plugin, easy to import with only the need for a few minor modifications to excisting products imported, it's has good options and interface.The attention to detail that these guys have put into the plugin on both the WooCommerce backend and Chrome frontend is amazing. The Chrome importer is awesome; the in-browser product editing and image editing functionality slashes the time it would take to import everything manually. Their support and community are also great. I've used various other platforms before but this is the first time I've used WooCommerce, and AliDropship Woo is without doubt a must-have for anyone using WooCommerce for a dropshipping store. Would love to see future similar plugins for other wholesale vendors/sites",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,LOVE Alidropship,"Great community, amazing plugin",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,"2 eyars customer, everything is great","Don't have much to say, we built a store on Woocommerce platform using alidropship. It's easy and not so expensive, there is no monthly fee. Love the add-ons! Thanks for all the hard work, guys and gals",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,Custom store creation,"I came over some websites made by alidropship and decided to start my dropshipping business with them too. I ordered a ready-made custom store with the basic option. Even with this option you'll have a well-designed store, domain, hosting, free theme (I use DaVinci theme), integration with social media and etc. I personally find my store looks great! Basic package includes 50 products and when your store come to live you can add more. Additionally, I have made lots of very special product descriptopns and last week I made my first sale. I would like to give my special thanks to my manager and to the rest of the team. After all I am convinced I made the right decision to work with them.",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,$89 absolutely worth it,"If you're ready to build your business, use alidropship. $89 absolutely worth it. Their blog is also amazing and full of educational posts!",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,My Alidropship experience,"I bought Alidropship about 3 months ago so would be happy to tell my experience with it. After the purchase, you can choose AliDropship original or Alidropship woocommerce. I choose alidropship original and absolutely happy about it. The installation was easy, I didn’t notice any difficulties or bugs. Anyway, before that I contacted my host's support team to check what version of PHP I have so recommend you to do the same. The themes are free. I use Davinci, it’s look pretty and has a high customization. After installation the plugin you simply browse and choose the products you want to add from AliExpress. Adding individual products is not easy by any stretch of the imagination. This process will be easier if you install alidropship chrome extansion in your chrome browser. With this tool once you have made your choices, just click a button and they are auto imported to your webstore. The beauty is that the profit margins stay consistent with the price automatically, and adjust if the price is adjusted by the supplier. In addition, the products are auto updated / removed in line with the suppliers updates on AliExpress. To sum up currently I use the Alidropship original plugin and some of the add-ons like facebook business and social rabbit. It actually helps a lot, especially the plugin. I would like to thank all alidropship team! Keep going your great work!",Alidropship,Trustpilot
1,A complete waste of $1000,"Spent $1000 to have AliDropShip build a ""custom"" site. They built a site, but it did not include features requested. Communications with them is next to impossible. The venue they use to ""communicate"" is worthless. Tried to contact them via Skype chat, and got terse apathetic responses. Multiple requests were made regarding various issues, but they never responded. Site was completed, with no WooCommerce installed.  The customer installed WooCommerce, and got notification that the installed AliDropShip plugin was not compatible with WooCommerce.  Installed the AliDropShip plugin which is supposed to be compatible with WooCommerce, and the site crashed.  Have requested a refund twice.  No response.",Alidropship,Trustpilot
3,Still not working but busy to use a better hosting provider,"This product might be perfect but only when it is working. The first step is registering the license code and this already did not work. When it is not working (like with me), nobody helps you. Be very careful buying this product. You should first find out if your hnsting provider has some minimal requirements like PHP 7.1, ionCube installed and enabled, etc. When you have a VPS environment with lots of knowledge to install what you need, it might be okay. Otherwise, be very careful because nobody helps you. I try to get my money back. I hope anyone who read this before buying, realize when it is not working, you never get it work with help from them.In the meantime Alidropship contacted me so this is the first step in better qualifying the product. The problem still isn't solved and the hosting provider don't want to look at this problem. So I am now busy to find some other hosting provider. You should know that this product need an environment with some special open ports (in/out) and not every hosting provider is suitable for this or has the knowledge to solve the problem, they mostly prefer to tell you that it is your fault (or Alidropship).",Alidropship,Trustpilot

1,Extremely disappointing,"Extremely disappointing. AliDropShip promises to build a  custom drop shipping website. Communication with AliDropShip through the development stages and after completion of the website was almost impossible. They are in Russia, so any attempt to communicate with them was during the late evening hours US time.  Skype text was the only venue which produced any results, and all of the correspondence from them was terse and apathetic. All attempts to contact their customer service by email were unanswered. The website was not what was desired, and did not incorporate features which were requested.  There was no assistance with installation and verification that installation had been accomplished successfully.  The website never functioned properly, and AliDropShip refused to diagnose the problem. WooCommerce was installed, and the site crashed. No help was available from AliDropShip.

5,find it incredibly useful!,"Alidropship is a fantastic plugin to help increase store efficiency and automate many processes that would usually require a person to have to do manually. You can find a lot of written an in-depth reviews of Alidropship, but I’d like to touch the main benefit of using Wordpress (and Alidropship) over another popular solutions… And that would simply be the monthly cost. So as you can see, Wordpress and AliDropship are so much cheaper than using Shopify and Oberlo. Although since I use Alidropship (with Wordpress) and have done for sometime now, I’ve never used Oberlo.. So I can speak for that service only as a cost issue. But I’ve heard some really great things about the Alidropship Plugin, I personally use it and find it incredibly useful!",Alidropship,Trustpilot

If their first suggestion does not work, they tell me something along the lines of ""Well, I don't know then. Better ask someone else.""

3,"Good, but expect to do major work.","The plug-in has to be congratulated for creating an almost turn key operation. There are a few challenges that no one mentions. For example, It is a breeze to import the products from AiExpress, however you must do major work on each item to make it respectable to English speakers. You have to examine with a fine tooth comb for grammar, photos with Chinese symbols, edit pictures take out ads from the manufacturer. There is a pretty steep learning curve especially if you've never done a WordPress site.One of the main purposes is to gather email names, but the sign up for newsletter offer is small and at the bottom at the page. Tried to use mailchimp drop down sign up but it didn't work but the plug in conflicts.The pricing on items disappeared. If you're not a WP expert you're going to need to hire help to get a decent drop down sign form.What I am saying is that you don't just buy and fly. AliDropship gets the product in, the rest is up to you. I'm :it's not just them but every dropship program. Also,since they are in China it takes 24 hours or more to get tech help. NOTE: They are located in Russia, not China.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

But still there's nothing I completely dislike about Alidropship system.",Alidropship,Trustpilot
2,I ordered a custom store but got multiple headaches.,"I ordered a custom store with a vision already planned in mind. I was very excited to be working with a team of developers to help improve my store and create it. However, I was ultimately disappointed. The store was very basic and it was obvious the developers just uploaded one of the three themes they had pre-made available and used minimum efforts to customize the theme itself. Not to mention that I have been getting frequent targeted attacks on my site. When I asked for support, the support team gave me very broad answers that I had to seek out on my own even though they advertise ""lifetime support"" as part of the custom dropship store basic plan. Whenever I request a few visual tweaks and edits to my site they would claim that they cannot customize clients' stores individually although they did not do very much to begin with. Even though I paid for a custom store it seems like I am doing most of the Wordpress CSS customization when I should really be focused on marketing to audiences. I actually spent an additional $25 out of pocket to pay for a visual site editor plugin because I lack the efficient skills to code.My original plan was to work with AliDropShip for the long-term and continually purchase multiple custom stores to create and market, developing more worthy assets. Sadly, after my first experience with buying a basic custom store this will be also be the last. I am not saying that the developers and team at AliDropShip are inefficient at their jobs. I just wished I received better support so I could have felt more comfortable with my first dropshipping experience. Shopify might be a little more expensive but save yourself the headache and trouble. Their support will personally help you if need be... I asked Shopify to help customize my store within the 14 day trial and one of the support members happily assisted me within 1 day no questions asked.",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,"Great too, great support... Highly reccomended!","Before alidropship i tried woodropship, which was good, but lacked a few features which are available in alidropship. Alidropship is excellent and allows for even importing the content in the description section as well as reviews. Had a couple hiccups getting started and The support team have been incredibly helpful and going the extra mile to make sure everything in the plugin is working well for me. If you have, or are thinking of starting a dropship website i would highly recommend this plugin! The one off price of the plugin is very reasonable, and personally i think they could charge an annual fee ontop of that, i would certainly be happy paying it.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

I personally love this feature the most because it prevents you from selling below AliExpress prices and will never allow items that are not available on the market to show up on your webstore.,Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,Alidropship review from me,"I absolutely LOVE this tool. Developers have created something that is worth every penny for a store owner. If you have a similar store then you already know how hard it is to manage it, but this tool makes it as easy as a few clicks to add and manage products. You simply browse and choose the products you want to add and once you have made your choices, just click a button and they are auto imported to your site. You can then customize the products as you wish (or leave them as they are) and apply custom formulas (simple school maths) to set your profit margins. The beauty is that the profit margins stay consistent with the price automatically, and adjust if the price is adjusted by the supplier. In addition, the products are auto updated/ removed in line with the suppliers updates on Aliexpress. This feature alone saves a HUGE amount of time and effort in monitoring your products to ensure they are up to date. There are many other features to this plugin that make it great but I don’t want to turn this post into a tutorial))",Alidropship,Trustpilot
5,I hope that helps!,"If you are starting dropshipping business then this plugin is a MUST. It will save you countless hours in struggling with the management of your store and will leave you to concentrate the more important side, the marketing.",Alidropship,Trustpilot

4,,It is a good app but has one major flaw in my opinion. The shipping costs are not calculated by the app. You just have to guess and set the cost in advance. Shipping costs can make or break a company.,Oberlo,Shopify

I felt I was pushing it with all my questions but their service was superb and offered to help more. Great bunch of people which make Oberlo that much better, besides that, once you have products in mind to import to your store, the process is so simple and easy. The learning material and content is also golden. Great app run by great people.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Very disappointing app. Rest on its laurels, it's worthless compared to ""shopmaster"". It's a pity that shopmaster is going to be taken off the shelves. Shopify will buy it to replace oberlo, otherwise the shop will have to be closed. It is too difficult to do dropshipping without shopmaster. No app can replace it. This is sad.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"First off, the price they set the product at is the resale price, NOT wholesale. I'm sorry, but I cannot waste my time trying to add products to my store and make zero money, walmart big lots target ect sell most of all of these products at the same cost you're wanting to sell to us a dropshipping reseller which is wrong.

2,,"well... ive used in past with almost trouble free, but miss some features like others app offer.... like advanced price match, etc a lot of features that OBERLO since 3-4 years ago what does is just change layouts.... support always give some type of answers like templates without almost 0 information we need, also if you came from another app they do not help in import, you have to manually override each one by one... in 2021 its the solution??????? price rules dont work good, and still use the ""multiplyer"" ONLY!! after 3-4 years they cant change or add more option? like change price only if price raise... set % multiplyer, set the product price cost with Shipping!! yes this is a must for nowdays... so now only way i see is manully set prices each time they change! to be 100% safe!!.

Their dashboard does not include shipping costs so when it lists your costs and earnings, those numbers are just wrong. It's a shame because it makes the dashboard useless for a business with a good amount of volume. I've reached out to them a couple times to fix this but so far it hasn't changed. Hopefully this review will get their attention! ✨✨✨✨✨ Please fix it!!! Aside from minor annoyances like the dashboard, the app is otherwise just as advertised. I don't use their search functions and I don't find products through Oberlo but I do use it for order placing and management. As far as that goes it's a very good product. When your store has hundreds of orders a month this helps to save loads of time and effort. From that perspective it gets a solid 4.5 stars! Recommended.",Oberlo,Shopify

O aplicativo estava muito bom, mas com essa atualização, além de horroroso, tem gerado alguns problemas.1) Ele tem indisponibilizado o produto 'na loja' em canais (Disponibilidade de produtos) e eu tenho que fazer um processo pra ajustar, que me rouba tempo. Isso não ocorre em todos!2) As atualizações de preços tem alterado constantemente de forma errada, trazendo o preço maior para menor. Com isso, eu configurei para não alterar mais, entretanto, mesmo assim, o problema persiste. 3) Todos os dias eu tenho que olhar um por um pra ver se isso ocorreu novamente, me gerando uma grande perda de tempo e, sempre aparece um ou outro e, eu tenho que corrigir.4) Ainda ontem percebi que a plataforma da Shopify, também havia feito alteração no sistema, inclusive no design 'azul' para 'verde' mas, logo no dia seguinte, eles voltaram atrás, o que eu achei bom!5) Quanto ao Oberlo, o anterior dava show de bola, era nota 1000. Resolveram mudar, mas mudaram muito. Deveria ser aos poucos. Na minha concepção, além dos problemas ocasionados, a nota para o novo Oberlo é '0'.Espero alterar minha nota do app para positivo.

But if your like the rest of us, or planning to have hundreds of product in your store. Than set you ass down and go through every product to see if they change. WHAT A BIG WASTE OF TIME. Thank You Oberlo for taking time away from my store. I hope you really fix this, like yesterday. oh, one more thing. take out the all white on the web page. You already know that is not good health for people's eyes. Just put everything back how it was and only ask US what type of change WE would like to have. Use a survey...DUH. We are paying for the service. ""If it's not broken don't fix it, otherwise you'll end up breaking it""",Oberlo,Shopify

1,,"After going back and forth with their support for days they just stopped responding. Items that were out of stock with the originating seller were never removed from my store. Variations were out of stock and never removed from my store, even though I had them linked properly and had the update settings correct. I ended up selling items that could no longer be purchased to my buyers. To say that this app caused a great amount of embarrassment to me is an understatement. DO NOT use this for dropshipping. Find another app.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,This app is AWFUL! I wasted two days of my life carefully editing and importing product only to have it deleted from my shopify store. This happened to me twice! There is no contact number and using that chat box is pointless. They did nothing to help me.,Oberlo,Shopify

5,,"Great service, quick communication and last but not leas! I definitely recommend it this way........",Oberlo,Shopify
2,,"Here's where I am right now. First, I chose a product that in the notes says it's free shipping in the U.S. I reached out to the shop and asked why I was being charged shipping, and reached out to Oberlo. Neither gave me a reason why it says free shipping and it isn't. Have 3 orders with the same shop, of course I paid for them and received a message they're not available. They offered another similar product, but that's not what i presented to my customers. I did ask if it was the same price, but you're talking a 9 hour delay with messaging because China. I've requested the orders to be canceled. It will take 3-10 days to refund my money and I have to order from somewhere else to fulfill what I have. I have no clue how to order from a different supplier and mark my Oberlo orders as shipped, but I don't think I'll get any help in that department, either. Currently out $200 with no products, no response, and absolutely ZERO confidence that this is a viable system. The extra star I gave was for the fluidity of the system and product selection. But none of that matters when you can't get any of the products you've sold. I say try anywhere but here.",Oberlo,Shopify
2,,"So far, I've made two sales through Oberlo, and on both of them, I had problems with the Ali Express suppliers. They are just not reliable, and they are damaging the reputation of my shop. I would recommend Oberlo to create a list of reliable Ali Express suppliers so it would be safer for us to do business using this app. As for my experience, I don't think installing Oberlo is advisable.",Oberlo,Shopify
4,,ontem e hoje meus pedidos que estão como pagos no shopify não estão aparecendo para serem processados !!,Oberlo,Shopify

4,,Works great but doesn't seem to be working at all today and there has been no email to say the site is going down for any reason which is a bit disappointing,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Installing this app was a great decision! Finding new products for my store is fast and easy! Nice work,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,It's pretty easy to use. It could be better but it gets the job done. I need to play around with it more.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Oberlo contacts are completely inactive, they don't care about their customers, everything happens when I need support when I sign up for the basic plan from them. The information shows that the payment was successful, but basically everything was not working. I still can't import the product list into my website, I texted them and they were all auto-replies or human messages every 6 hours to get a reply, really is a disaster",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Oberlo helps me a lot with finding new products for my online stores! It saves so much time and effort.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I chose to dropship on Shopify using this app.  I chose suppliers that supply to US market.  Oberlo sucks as they have not filtered out their suppliers properly and customers end up loading supplier that don't show US sizes, but only US sizes  (see example below).  Many such shoes are on my website now and i have started marketing.  Now i have to go clean out all 250 shoes to check for US sizes.  This is a mess.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,This app is really amazing! It is sooo easy to search new products for my shopify stores. Highly recommend it!,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"This program has all of the features you need to select products from AliExpress and upload them to my store and assign them to categories, to create the perfect shopping experiences. The downside is also an issue if you need to fix an error. It requires a difficult process",Oberlo,Shopify

5,,"Excellent app, great integration. Makes life so much easier! Can even browse products right in the app.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Great app!!! I really like the demo video on how dropshipping with Oberlo works! Thank you for making this,Oberlo,Shopify
2,,"This app works as it should; however, it's connected to AliExpress, which is a shot in the dark.  I understand that AliExpress is a platform with various storefronts for customers of all sorts. Still, it works, and it doesn't. I've had some lost orders, which makes my business look terrible.  Items are slow for delivery, and things are lost continuously or untrackable. It's best to have the product at home and send it out with a FedEx, USPS, Etc., with a tracking number so that you know where your sent items are going and delivered.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,The thing I like the most about this app is the possibility to explore many new products to sell in my store,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"if your making hundred of dollars, get out of this game. if your making thousands you NEED this. period.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I wouldn't recommend this app for anyone the shipping takes forever and you cant track your packages. If you enjoy giving refunds then this the app for you. If you don't like giving refunds then stay away from this app. Customers are unhappy waiting so long. I can't tell them where is the package( tracking is a joke) and when it will be delivered. I paid for shipping 16-26 days and it is over a month and wasn't delivered yet. I can't say if it is in China or Canada , Last tracking updates where two days after the package was shipped and no more tracking. Customers already asking me where is the package and I was told that they will report me to the bureau for fraud.  Oberlo app is working good but making business with aliexpress is not the way Oberlo is telling you.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,很不错的软件，有库存同步，还可以直接把速卖通上的产品listing导入到我的店铺里面。目前还没有尝试直接下单的功能，如果直接下单功能也能同步的话那真的是相当不错了。 另外一个问题就是如果软件后台可以显示物流表现的话，会更好。,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,This app is nothing but Alie Express and Alie Express is BADD !!! My customers are livid about the shipping times I dont think these orders are coming from USA even when you click on ships from USA!!! YALL NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER ON HERE I FEEL LIKE IM BEING SCAM OUT OF MY MONTHLY $30 A MONTH !! PLEASE DO BETTER SHOPIFY,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"This would be a fine app if it had the ability to connect with different drop shipping suppliers other than Ali Express in China. The functionality of the app is okay. However, with this limitation of dealing with China's suppliers/products, Oberlo is the perfect vehicle to set the beginning drop shipper up for failure. Remember, Oberlo exists to sell you on Shopify. As long as they can seemingly make it easy, it's likely that you'll buy into the monthly subscription. The Oberlo 101 course (which is not appropriately updated with the current Facebook format) makes it even more attractive but, again, connecting with Chinese suppliers puts you in a position of developing a bad reputation with your potential customers (if you get any). Why? Because it will take over a month, on average, for your customers to receive their ordered products. Oberlo, via their training and promotional videos, does everything it can to convince you that being concerned about disappointing your customers in this manner is hardly necessary. That in itself qualifies Oberlo to be placed in the category of ""e-commerce scams.""",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,This app makes finding and adding products to my store incredibly easy. It only takes a few clicks to add a product to your store.,Oberlo,Shopify

Every product that you import that has free shipping when finally purchase on your store eds up costing between 5-15 dollars shipping, making it impossible to calculate costs and profit. Will only make you lose money and the shipping times are insanely too long 45-65 days. Tons of errors and bugs. Do not install it. Store owners beware. Shopify needs to remove them!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Love this app! So simple to use and makes finding products for my store so easy. This is a must have for every new Shopify store.,Oberlo,Shopify

2,,"Their getting worse everyday, their customer service is a total joke. And their software seems to get more outdated as time passes, really sad. They should be ashamed of themselves.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I took the time to audit all of the products that I offer through Oberlo/AliExpress today. I had to remove 10 products due to either a change in price. (if the business changes the shipping price you don't get notified) in volume available, discontinued variants, and items that are not allowed to be shipped to the U.S. . None of these did I receive a notification for. I have lost money dealing with Oberlo/AliExpress and if I had not done an audit I could have lost everything.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Terrible app!  Takes 72 hours for oberlo to update inventory so you could be selling unavailable products. Oberlo qualified products to add are searchable in their search engine, oberlo allows you to add them to your site only to to have them removed a few days after as they dont meet their terms which they give no rhym or reason for.   They expect you to manually check each product daily and resync it with the seller daily or manually change it. This app is a joke, dont waste your time or ruin your reputation over it!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Excellent app to get started and sell a few hundred bucks a month. Once you scale, have a considerable amount of orders and different shipping providers through Aliexpress, it's not right. I have been using this app for over one years",Oberlo,Shopify

They have made updates in the last few weeks that literally downgraded the app. Now you have to place your orders item by item which is taking me 3 times longer to place all my orders each day! They will tell you you can use the bulk order function.. Well NO because the bulk ordering function doesn't let you change the shipping method in Ali so I then spend my time cancelling the orders manually to replace them manually item by item... Too bad!

1,,"Don't use Oberlo with Ali if you want to actually run a business. Even Shopify merchants processing look down upon it. Oberlo app looks nice and easy to use unfortunately it works with Ali Express which is the absolute worst. Use a dropship agent, or Alibaba dropship or other avail option if your taking your business serious. You'll end up getting 50-60% of your orders with NO Tracking number, 7-10 day delays with terrible customer service from Ali vendors. Meanwhile other dropshipping apps have much more reliable sellers with much better customer service. If your doing this a $100 month side business and don't care than Oberlo with Ali would be fine. But if your going to make a business out of your store, listen to everyone before that want's a long term option, that Shopify payments will perfer, and retain actuall repeat business which is almost impossible using Oberlo with Ali in 2020.",Oberlo,Shopify

2,,"I agree with other reviewers, the support is absolute crap. They have given the most unhelpful, generic responses to my questions/concerns. My shipping notification emails stopped being sent to customers randomly. Their response to my question about this was to say I hadn't had shipping notifications set up (I did-notifications were sent out just fine for other orders), I needed a shipping policy page (I have this), and I needed a track your order page (also have this on my site). Not sure what the latter two points have anything to do with my initial question. I'm not sure the staff behind their support is at all trained in the details behind their app. I also think they think their app is infallible so anything that goes wrong is the customer's fault.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Excellent application for Drop-shipping business model,Love it. Adding products is made easier when you use this application.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Support is crap. It should be way way better. When you leave a message, they start a chat with you with one sentence, and you keep on typing messages. You wont hear from them again they will just leave you there in the conversation. If they get back to you, you will get a scripted robotic answer. I think they should learn from Shopify how shopify to the chat support. Oberlo support is not customer service oriented and feels like taken for granted service.",Oberlo,Shopify

The interface is easy and it connects to shopify super easily.- The margins are good (if you pick your products right, but more on that in the cons).- Huge selection. You can really get deep into niche offerings. Which again ties into the picking the right products.",Oberlo,Shopify

1,,"UPDATED:  If you have had the misfortune of getting involved with this awful app, check your auto generated customer email notification settings carefully.  The code to email customers that the order has shipped is wrong.  I've had customers going to dead end links that say invalid tracking numbers.  Customers are calling me a scam and giving me poor reviews.  All because they cannot get the accurate tracking information I provided for them in the settings of the auto-generated emails.  I would just advise anyone to run from Oberlo.  Every step of the way it has been an absolute disaster of incompetence and utter willful abandonment.  There is zero customer support, not one thing works as it should, and all they do is gaslight you with bots, and when a live (allegedly) person actually DM's, they just send links to videos to teach you why you aren't doing something properly (even though you are doing exactly as the videos say) when the app is really just total junk.  They won't acknowledge the ""instructions"" are wrong; they'll just send you another irrelevant training video.  They don't fix ANYTHING.  They admit to fault.  They take absolutely zero responsibility for their incompetent failing ineffective error ridden app.  It's an absolute disaster and a death sentence for small budget just starting out.  Really Oberlo is shopify's way to point the finger instead of providing support.  I mean really, why are email tracking notifications set up in Oberlo in the first place?  What about the plethora of other (better) apps I use?  I'd actually skip Shopify too if I had it to do over. I'm working everyday to sever my ties with both shopify and oberlo.

If an app does what I need it to do, doesn't look tacky, and the company has good customer support, that’s everything you need.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Very good app. makes finding products from aliexpress easier and imports them to your store. also this app is easy to use.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Super super simple to use. Finding and adding the products for my store took about 5 minutes. The selection of products is also impressive.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Horrible app! THEY ARE SCAMMERS !! I bought my store 10 months ago and changed the subscription plan to the starter plan . THe previous owner had the paid basic plan. THey have charged me the basic plan price of 29 per month for 10 months. When i examined my credit card and realized the mistake i contacted Obero support. Basically what i got was a bunch of gaslighting and manipulations and lies. They are sticking to their scam of charging people for the incorrect plan. Horrible app and horrible customer support. I feel so violated,Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"Oberlo has almost everything, but the delivery time causes me to lose customers. Is there a solution to speed delivery to customers? I know Oberlo is just an aliexpress broker but if you can help show me an alternative for faster delivery please.",Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"When this app works properly it's a great time saver. When using it to fulfil orders, it is important to double check the information sent to AliExpress because on more than one occasion, it has put the wrong address on an order resulting in me having to refund the customer while still having to pay for the goods ordered.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Oberlo is awesome. Can sell without keeping inventory. Support is great, nice company, keep up the good work.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Price of Oberlo is extremely expensive, need lower lower pricing like first month $10 for 10000 items, $20 for unlimited then gradually increased after 3rd month.Oberlo need integration and synchronization not only with aliexpress but also with amazon, ebay, taobao, tmall.Reduce oberlo pricing so new startup merchants can easily adapted.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Cheap Chinese knockoffs being sold. No US based suppliers allowed to sell on platform. Exclusive to Aliexpress which means there is a huge language barrier and shipping times take forever,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,This is SERIOUS! I sell knives and I have done so for years. I was BLOWN AWAY to see Oberlo offering clone and counterfeit knives to U.S. sellers to dropship. Setting new and not so knowledgable sellers up for failure and even possibly legsl issues! NO WAY OBERLO! I will never recommend you to anyone! Serious FAIL!!!,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,Useful and essential to my store! I think the UI could use some work and a lot of items are not connected to strong stores.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,very easy to use app. Can find products easily and can add to the store easily. products are from aliexpress but they appear on my website and get added to the lists of products.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"It is a great concept and it is something that could definitely work IF applied properly. Supplier did not respond and as per T&Cs, you can't recoup your cancel your order until X days. This meant I had to source the very scarce product manually (not from Oberlo) at a loss, and then post it myself. This defeats the concept of drop shipping. Oberlo needs to be vetting suppliers at the start and even periodically!! Perhaps my experience is an anomaly, however it is mine to share and that is the exact reason you get 1 star. I was tempted to do 2 star, however because of Oberlo's slow time to respond, you only get 1 :(",Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"我希望加入一些統一的小眾品牌文化無論是電子數碼產品 還是飾品衣服等等包裝也希望環保和不錯的設計讓我們直銷業務提高讓每一個商家來去宣傳他們的產品以保證客戶對我們的彼此信任,在運輸上希望可以縮短時間希望都可以做到7-15天",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"takes to long 60-90 days to receive item and all items are either returned or end up in the bin as the quality is so poor. So many fakes and counterfeits not a good way to run a business. They charge you $29 a month for nothing. You cant provide a service you provide junk items, things that no one wants. Even the 5 star suppliers cant provide good products and shipping times wow even if you pay extra for fasting shipping it still takes 2-3 months. Suppliers pocket the extra you pay for shipping , ripping of so many people its not even funny anymore",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Based on one month of experience with the app, it works as promised, plus they provide tons of helpful articles and youtube videos about how to use the app.",Oberlo,Shopify
4,,Oberlo works as described. You still have to make sure you are signed into AliExpress with your own account. It does capture product photos and variants seamlessly. I only import certain products from AliExpress due to low quality on clothing and jewelry. Big issue: Shipping times are long..customers are used to faster ship/delivery times.  Now that is worse due to TRUMP removing the U.S from USP which is a parternehip that provides incredibly low cost China epacket shipping and fast delivery . That is now over. For now it may take more than 25 days for delivery. See more here.  https://mywifequitherjob.com/aliexpress-dropshipping-oberlo-epacket/,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"APP is not working properly. Items are no longer available at the supplier or cost prices change and we didn't get any notification as we were supposed to.

Totally unsatisfied with your service.""",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Lacks functionalities like bulk edit or bulk delete of products. Recently Oberlo stopped their Oberlo Verified Suppliers, which they kept saying it's the best thing ever...

5,,I love how fast they respond to support questions. They are very helpful and I'm very happy with the service,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I had a blazer listed on my website that was listed through Oberlo for a super low price.  When it came to fulfill the order, the price that I needed to pay was eight and a half times higher.  I can't recommend or trust an app that will change prices at the tip of a hat.  Do not use.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,I love how Oberlo workd just dont like Aliexpress shipping times ....we are in this generation were they want the product fast ! 14 days tops....sorry im deleting the app cause i need something trust worth and durable,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I tried OBERLO. It has a seamless amazing powerful outstanding integration. But I am totally dissatisfied…. I have added a product from ""AliExpress"" to my Shopify store. I got my first order. I was shocked to discover that AliExpress has used my information from my Shopify order and sent a marketing email to my customer asking him to join AliExpress to be able to track his shipment.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Very good app. Adds value. I imported products. Still in the process of setting up my store and sales channels. Didn't make a sale yet, but the app itself is working fine.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Hey there, im having a really hard time trying to import a product. It's not working at all, even from other big sellers who sell the same product. I really don't wanna go for a seller on Oberlo who only sold this product 200x in the last 6 months. The sellers from aliexpress which i want to import the product from got like 500 orders a day!",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Hi, I just linked to Shopify. Heard group things about the app. Am really excited to use it in my online story. But whenever I load it all I get is a white screen. What is the problem?",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,If you're about to start drop shipping aliexpress products through Shopify this is definitely the app for you.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,ottima app per inserire i prodotti di aliexpress all'interno del vostro store con un semplice click. facile da utilizzare e molto intuitiva. la consiglio,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Oberlo verified supplier missed the shipping time, tried to contact Oberlo but no response & now I'm having tons of refund request!",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I use this app, there is no customer service what so ever, after complaint to Shopify came to find out its Shopify product.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,I love this app. Your app is the only app that work out of all the apps i tried all are scams. You make it easy for me to find the sellers so i can complete my order. I do love your site. 100 ****** compared to the rest of the apps.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"truly awesome! i recommend it with my eyes closed!didn't have to use the support yet, so can't talk about it, but the rest is pretty awesome.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Flawless! The customer service responses fast and gives back helpful feedback to your questions and needs!,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"this app is good and work good, only minor bugs that they have include like including shipping costs on COSTS dashboard. autoprice change should change only by atual price set, and not by autorule, because super expensive shippings costs on some products its dificult use autorules. i seen many talking about dropified but the reallity is we are using oberlo for about 300 orders and 0 issue, also all issues the merchants solve easy, BUT super sad about oberlo remove suppliers offcorse! and that for sure will send people out oberlo i think.... i hope the app still work great! i only give 4 starts because they remove oberlo suppliers and that was AMAZING!! hope not get many problems now with aliexpress supliers.....",Oberlo,Shopify
2,,Overall it works (kinda) but beware putting your full trust into it. Oberlo will let you down and so will their support service.,Oberlo,Shopify
2,,Do not use this app if you are going to use GOOGLE SHOPPING (or Facebook Ads) for advertise your product.,Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"The app is easy to use.  With the upcoming changes in July 2019 I may delete the app because no one wants to deal ONLY with AliExpress and experience EXTREMELY LONG delivery times which will result in lost customers and revenue. Oberlo should have kept things the way they were, where you can look up specific suppliers and import products directly to your store. Shipping times of 2 to 3 weeks is horrible and bad for business. This was a great creation by Shopify with suppliers that had reasonable prices and fast shipping.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Oberlo Ending but still advertising. WHY?Reviewed.Pulled your suppliers and we feel double crossed. You are unreliable and this leaves us with little faith of the whole concept of dropshipping. Having to delete all my products now since it will be ridiculously time consuming trying to find substitute suppliers. I wasted hours days weeks starting my store and you totally pulled the rug out from under me. Leaves me to question shopify too. Waste of my precious time effort and money. Thanks for nothing OBERLO and shopify.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Ive been using this app for a year. Ive ordered over 5000 times. Ill tell you and save you a bunch of time and terrible customer service. DONT USE THIS APP.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"I rarely write reviews. If you are reading this review, it is in 2 parts. First part making money. Can you make money using Oberlo. The answer is absolutely yes! I make money daily selling Ali-Express products using the Oberlo app.  However, the real answer is Oberlo is simply a platform. Making money requires a lot of time sourcing the right product, right supplier and proper marketing. Which also means it does take a lot of time product testing, writing and rewriting product descriptions, and it does cost you money to get started. If you get the correct mix of those things you will make money. The ease of importing to the app after sourcing and importing products in my opinion is fantastic. Being able to track the entire sales flow for my customers is great! Lastly, I think the upfront training and additional email training - if you subscribe is well worth it.",Oberlo,Shopify
4,,I am not sure how well this app works. I am here because I learnt a lot from Oberlo. In particular I am here because of Jessica. Her constructive advice helps me everyday.https://shawlinshop.com,Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"I've been using Oberlo for two years now. This is a long review, I’ve never reviewed an app on here and I am doing so to help anyone starting out in dropshipping. I use Oberlo mostly for the ease of pushing products to my store. Along the two years with their app updates somehow it manages to sneakily make my products switch in my shopify store from Shopify fulfillment to Oberlo Fulfillment. I started to stock inventory therefore some items I need fulfilled in Shopify and I have deleted them from Oberlo. So when  this happens it has caused many times of me having to creating duplicate orders in Shopify in order to fulfill the items in my Shopify admin. I switch the products and each individual variant back to Shopify Fulfillment and again sneakily it gets switched back to Oberlo.",Oberlo,Shopify
2,,So disappointed with Oberlo. I had just upgraded my plan and within days they discontinued providing verified suppliers. Said this would come into effect July 15/19 but I can no longer import from any of their verified suppliers and it is only April. I sent an e-mail but have received little support. Just a sorry e-mail and some links . I was so comfortable working with verified suppliers and now feel like I've been thrown to the aliexpress wolves with no guidance from Oberlo. Very Disappointed in Oberlo- No regard for your paying customers!,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Got rid of oberlo suppliers I absolutely will not replace these products with aliexpress suppliers. Time to find a new free app or US suppliers that don’t charge rediculous prices,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Oberlo has FAILED massively as a Shopify App. Do NOT use them as they have no consideration for those merchants using their service. Oberlo used to provide access to various suppliers that they had ""verified"". This allowed merchants to find suppliers in the USA as well as those providing quality products & services with very fast shipping. HOWEVER, Oberlo now ONLY uses AliExpress (which is mostly junk trinkets with ridiculously slow shipping & unresponsive suppliers). Therefore, merchants who used trusted suppliers through Oberlo no longer can & as a result Oberlo's actions will put merchants out of business. It's quite clear that Oberlo did not take it into consideration the tremendous adverse impact this ""decision"" will have to those merchants using its services utilizing Oberlo Suppliers or Verified Suppliers. When I contacted their support team all they could say is ""we apologize for the inconvenience"". This is beyond ""inconvenience"". Very disappointed is an understatement. BE WARNED - DO NOT ENTRUST YOUR BUSINESS IN THE HANDS OF OBERLO OR YOU WILL BE SCREWED!",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,I do not know what these people did but their platform changed they only have Alliexpress Chinese Junk I like their prior platform when you could choose from different suppliers I uninstalled and looking for a USA based manufacturer and supplier. My customers do not want cheap crap and they do not want to wait 30 days for there purchase yeah you can get merch at low cost but it is junk. Hopefully they will go back to there prior platform .,Oberlo,Shopify
2,,"If you sell jewelry through this app, you are really just selling junk. There were some interesting pieces but to be honest, even those are junk. I can't bring myself to make my customers wait a month for a product that is going to be extremely poorly packaged and that they will ultimately not feel good about owning. Many of the suppliers are sketchy.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"This is an Amazing APP. Thank you, Shopify for making things easier for newbies to source and sell products.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Classic app, a must have for a business, good products, good suppliers, and good client support. What else ?",Oberlo,Shopify
4,,I need you to update the platform for purchases in Alieexpress. Aliexpress has been updated and is not picking up the addresses for shopping.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"The app wont let me pay, ive already imported over 300 products, waste of time. Dont use this shitty app.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"This app makes me wonder whats goin on behind the scenes at Shopify. As hard as this app is pushed, and how little it delivers, I wonder if someone has a hand in developing this app. I cant fault them for the poor quality of products, but they really need to source some things from the USA, and regulate much more strictly on things that are junk. I've only had my personal friends willing to wait for a month and a half for the delivery of products. Suppliers using up a week of that to fulfill an order should not be considered for eligibility when you're trying to compete with amazon. Yes, there are U.S. warehouses, but the selection is so limited, it is abysmal. The only way I can describe this app is the fastest way to damage your store's reputation.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Like other users have mentioned, this app has no practical use if you're trying to operate any sort of respectable store. I simply cannot have my customers waiting a month to receive a product! Product selection as a result is not very trendy. In addition, it looks like this app has some serious data confidentiality issues. After I installed the app, I kept getting fake traffic from Pexgle- other dropshippers trying to spy on my products. Do yourself a favor and pass on Oberlo!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"hello, we use this app for a long time . we like this app ! a great way to succeed ! so easy to use ! great.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Product selection is remarkable. I was able to find every product needed for our customers with ease.,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,I have heard great things about this app and look forward to trying it out. The on boarding flow was working well.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Perfect in every way except for the MAJOR fact that they don't have a captcha solver for AliExpress checkout... Seriously wtf.  Fulfilling HUNDREDS of orders and having to enter a captcha code at every checkout is absolutely ridiculous.  I recommend Dropified which did the tiny amount of work necessary to incorporate this feature.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,They have excellent customer service! I have had some questions and they have helped me solve them fast.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,it's many error. you need to check again if don't want it wrong name and address. many our orders was wrong until I check on My order,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"muito útil para o trabalho, pretendo mudar para o plano pró assim que possível, por enquanto está atendendo meus objetivos.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"This app is a classic drop shipping starting point. Easy to identify products for integration, easy to edit details as well. Now, I wish it kept initial cost data where after importing I could more easily determine my product cost profiles, but it is a small issue at present.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Awesome,  You can easily Import Products from AliExpress and Manage Them. Excellent! thanks for your work. thank your very much",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Awesome app! I love using this app. It has a lot of opportunities.,Oberlo,Shopify

1,,"horrível! sistema esta 3 semanas com problemas e ninguém faz nada, não vale o valor pago!  sistema travou com o fornecedor antigo e não troca de maneira nenhuma, ja mandei diversos emails e nada de resolverem, me sinto como se não tivesse ninguém ara ajudar nessas horas",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Très déçus pour débuter dans le dropshipping de mon coté aucune commande ne s'affichais sur l'applis oberlo même une étoile n'est pas mériter,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,Really good app. I love it. One helpful thing would be to import the whole product description page from the seller page on Aliexpress. This would help save time and allow me to not have to go back and forth between seller's page and Oberlo.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Amazing App! Helped me a lot but if they can provide an option hot products then it'll be a 6 star app,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Great app easy import to my shopify store. So many different niches to choose from. Great app for getting started with dropshipping. Not complicated and user friendly.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Oberlo lets me start my own business and sell almost anything! It makes me so happy. They also very nice when I ask fo help (｡◕‿◕｡),Oberlo,Shopify
1,,It's 2019 and you still don't have decent suppliers for anywhere other than CHINA. No one wants to wait 2-6 weeks for delivery.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Sorting through and communicating with potential suppliers is daunting. Oberlo helped us to be much more efficient with our time. We have found the app intuitive to use. Syncing has been pretty straight forward. Verified suppliers are a must for us. We also appreciate the massive amount of resource and tutorial information available from Oberlo.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Half of the items customers ordered never arrived.  Most I never received a refund for - so you will spend money to tick off your customers.  Customers who never receive the item they ordered do not buy from you again.  The order on demand concept seems ideal, but there is no way to hold anyone accountable or a way to review the vendor you are ordering from to ensure you will actually receive your items! Find another way to work your business.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Check out the new ali express drop shipping which is FREE... I like there UI better and don't have a single complain because I can import thousands and thousands of items for FREE.. this app is a highway robbery and I don't like the fact there preferred dealers are selling the same items on Aliexpress with free epacket shipping and here we have to pay 2-3 dollars... good way to mark up your prices,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"This app doesn't seem to work. When I search a keyword, such as ""soccer"" it shows that there are 47,000 products available, but nothing shows up for me to view or import. When I try to click through categories nothing shows up other than to say how many products are available.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,imported products from oberlo... and fulfill orders from other suppliers - external suppliers. now they are not allowing to mark the orders fulfilled from shopify orders. Forcing us to pay for the subscription. going to remove the app to fulfill my orders.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Insane app! Makes dropshipping possible for the normal entrepreneur. I really love this app. I don't even have to explain it. It is a must-have and everyone knows it. I love Oberlo! It makes so much possible! Thanks a lot, Devs! Highly recommended! Most important app in all of my stores.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Every order nowadays seems to have a different error and we have to find another supplier on aliexpress ourselves, it really isnt working well and im surprised there are so many positive reviews. we are getting about 40% failure on orders, no stock, order not accepted by aliexpress etc etc and of course the chat support seems to be non existent for such a large business",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"When Oberlo imports the information of the request, the data of the field ""address 2"" is merged, with the data of the field ""company""... and we have to manually correct each of the requests ... I asked the support and they said that they are tests and that the solution was for me to delete the data of the company field ... absurd ... where is the automation of the service?",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Oberlo is the one of the best app that is being help to us. Thanks a lot for being such a great app Oberlo.. Thanks!!!,Oberlo,Shopify
2,,"When I started my business, The first app., I started using for my suppliers was Oberlo. Oberlo has always been easy, and I have never had any issues with them. I left because I wanted to see what else was out there. I came back and so many things have changed. What happened to the USA companies? I wanted to sign up but without the USA company listings forget it! Disappointed!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,A very good app that is useful for drop shipping products of various kinds. It is important to use good suppliers who deliver what customers order quickly.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,This is very good app . I use free app for beginning my site www.impact-phoenix.comThe products are so cute.,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"Easy to use but it can be better, But Aliexpress shipping is low. I prefer free app. so I will stick with EPROLO, fast shipping and free to use.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Do not use this app to dropship products. First, the suppliers hardly ever provide tracking numbers, and the shipping takes forever or your customers may not receive their products at all. I have customers that placed orders before Christmas and they still have not received products. Horrible Horrible service.",Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"I really like this app, it helps streamline adding items to my store.  One big glaring problem: I can't change clothing sizes.  I tried before importing to my store, but the app says, ""There is another product variant with same option values,"" even though I already edited the other size.  It wouldn't be a problem if it let me just import to my store as is.  Can't blame it too much, as Shopify has the same problem.  The way around that is to use other letters, then import, and edit back to standard sizes.  A bit of a hassle, but still a great app.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"First time trying dropshipping for Hndproductstnt and I think this is one of the worse mistakes we've made till date. We were burned by American Dropship. It promised delivery in 8-18 days and products were expected by the 14th, 16th etc and haven't arrived yet. When I track them they say they are still in Germany. When I contacted American Dropship's support, they just said its technical issues, which is completely unacceptable and now they aren't replying. We have a policy that you get a refund if the product isnt delivered in the estimate time, so we're in a pretty bad situation. Useful app but the verified suppliers aren't very reliable. They have put a dent in our reputation surely. DO NOT USE.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,One of best free apps in Shopify. I used for my website doublehandles.com and really love it. Good one.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"The products ALL come from China. This means there is no real time frame when the customer will receive their package. That is NOT acceptable. I do not care what anyone says about this Company, your inconsistency is poor business ethics and you should be ashamed of yourself. I have found reputable suppliers in the US that provide free and low cost shipping with quality products and better business ethics. I wish I could give you negative star rating because that is about all you are worth. Lesson learned!",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"The issue that I have with your app is that it changes the Shopify interface, forcing the user to enter tracking numbers through Oberlo. However, as soon as Oberlo perceives those 50 orders in a month regardless of whether or not the user actually uses Oberlo to enter tracking numbers for those 50 orders, or even used Oberlo for anything regarding those orders, it immediately blocks the user from entering any more tracking numbers though the Shopify interface unless they pay you the $29.90. Literally a scam. Do not waste your time or money on this app, there are apps that will do the exact same thing for free and won't try to SCAM you.",Oberlo,Shopify
2,,"I find it really incredible that an app with so many years and so much promotion online fails in importing data from Aliexpress. It works well with Oberlo suppliers. Other than that, it needs lots of work to be fully useful.",Oberlo,Shopify

3,,"Who doesnt like dropshipping?! It is a great app when starting your journey into the online world, you can have a ecommerce store set up in literally a few day!",Oberlo,Shopify
2,,"The app is easy to use, the problem are the products - Like many, I shop for myself on AliExpress accepting the 2-3 weeks shipping time because the it's cheap and unbranded. Why in the world I would shop to a website paying more for the same 2-3 weeks wait? No real sense.My customers don't want to wait, they are ready to pay a premium for fast shipping.Not worth it.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Very good app. Make everything easier. Although I have to pay for some stuff. But is ok. Thanks a lot,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Great App. I have been using this for some of my stores and has always worked. Love the fulfil option,Oberlo,Shopify

1,,"This app is utterly disgusting. It is one giant confusing mess. They do not fulfill, nothing is automatic, you save your card but you still need to input it and then aliexpress what ever that is, is just useless, everything bounces around, screens and things are popping up and closing and doing god knows what. Their support is okay and my first customer from oberlo, I had to refund.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Ich bin wirklich sehr Begeistert von der App. Auch in der free version ist sie einfach nur der Hammer. Ich habe immer mehr gelernt in der App und sie erleichtert mir die Arbeit unendlich Dolle,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"This app sucks. It is not capable of importing your existing products, unless you do it one by one. It is only good for adding new products to your store. There are other similar apps out there that can sync your whole store in 1 click, I would suggest to use any of them, as this one is useless.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"The worst platform of this type. The customer care takes days to answer (when they do), and their payment system doesn't work properly.

1,,The app is not working most of the time. It's awful it doesn't transfer orders correctly causing u to get bad reviews. Don't use this app.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"You guys, the ones who rated oberlo with 4 and 5 stars, all would change your opinion if I told you that AliExpress has an affiliate program where you'll receive a unique link to share with others but also an API Key that can be integrated into your site, and get back between 3-13% of the costs of your goods sold. So, basically, oberlo is benefiting from your hard work, and getting between 3-13% commissions from of EVERYTHING you spend on aliexpress. Yes, that is right! What did I try to do? I reached out to them and told them that I wanted to put my API Key (affiliate link, same thing) into the oberlo app and they just said:",Oberlo,Shopify

2,,Update: Nov 7 2018:After trying one last time to reach Oberlo tech support with no success I tried reaching out to Shopify tech support  - since they own the Oberlo app. In the past whenever I have contacted Shopify tech support the results have been very professional. The gurus are usually easy to communicate with and the issues are solved. This time was no exception. Lisa was the guru who helped me and within minutes we had found the source of the problem to be DNS related. A quick google search and some changes to the DNS settings and everything was working. Thank you Lisa!  In the fun words of older people... Lisa is Superduper.  (If anyone else is experiencing the same problem with their Oberlo app here is a link to the solution that worked for me https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/dns_probe_finished_nxdomain/),Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"HORRIBLE! Oberlo doesn't even help with bad product and you can't file a dispute for bad product because it's always having an issue. Also, instead of helping they just show you how to order more product.Customer service doesn't care about bad problems they just want you to buy.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I am extremely disappointed on their decision to take away all the suppliers. This has always been my favorite app, now I am afraid I may have to let it go. Now all they show are Junk from China from Alliexpress, I refuse to put any JUNK items from China in my store. China items are bad quality and shipping takes over 30 days or more or sometimes items are never received. My store is USA based and everything is from USA only. This is truly a sad day and its heartbreaking because Oberlo was such a great app till now. Taking the suppliers away was a very bad decision. I am sure many merchants would agree. Now I had to drop a few stars..I am afraid due to this change they will lose a lot of loyal merchants. I truly wish they would reconsider. If they don't reconsider keeping their prior platform with the USA suppliers I will have no choice but to uninstall in July. And seeing these fake reviews of people justifying Aliexpress wont help and wont work. Everyone knows Aliexpress or any products from China is absolutely THE WORST! China are scam artists ripping USA consumers off of billions of dollars with bad products, lies, scams and poor service. I know 1st hand from experience because I got ripped off from China. Us USA merchants value our customers and our products. Oberlo made a vary bad business decision by doing away with good quality verified suppliers and will hurt their reputation unless they fix this and immediately.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Merci à oberlo pour cette application magnifique, très facile à utiliser vous pouvez importer tous les produits que vous voulez directement dans votre boutique un grand merci a l'équipe oberlo",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"This app was the maximum until the terms and conditions changed, you can not tell me which products I can import and which ones do not, so customers are lost, it's a shame I'll have to move to dropified.",Oberlo,Shopify
3,,I have been using this app for a while with no issues. I was quite happy. I recently updated my prices with another app in bulk and now 60-80% of my products aren't syncing with oberlo. This means orders aren't synced between shopify and oberlo and don't show up in oberlo. I have been advised to overide all of the affected products. This will take days if not weeks to fix. You have been warned. The app needs some way of identifying or highlighting products that are not in sync. It also needs a better way of resyncing. Overriding is a workaround not a solution.,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"My experience with support from Oberlo has been spotty at best.  Main problem is I will state the problem or question and the response is an article that has little or nothing to do with me question. Second complaint is a terribly slow wait time until you do get a response. 4 hours or more before you get a response is common.  Sometimes it would be the next day. They do apologize for the long wait time to response, but say the reason is they have just been so busy.Shopify, on the other hand, offers quick response with a solution that matched the question.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,I don't think they truly understand what business they are in.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"If you want to dropship with shopify, oberlo is your only choice. Easy to use and so many products to sell! check it out and check my website https://pineappleapparel.net/",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,I contacted Oberlo because I didn't know how to add their icon to my website. I received a response very quickly. They were friendly and helpful.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Call very bad, do not use the suppliers of the obelro. Little support, they do not send the product in the correct time, the oberlo can not solve anything.The best thing is to use the same aliexpress providers because they do not fulfill anything of what they promise.",Oberlo,Shopify

5,,"This app helped me a lot with my pugyou.net store by saving time and money. I recommend, and i hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did",Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"Meh. Just meh. The app is absolute crap when using the shopify app on my phone or ipad. So much for portable work. It just doesn't work. And the search function is crap, too. I'm certain they make enough money to make it work, don't they?",Oberlo,Shopify
3,,Hard to use. Seems powerful but takes a long time to figure this out. Also have to get used to going back and forth between different windows and took me forever to figure out how to navigate back and forth.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Application number1! I love it! In addition a lot of very relevant information that sends us by email and help support is sick, fast and they immediately find what I wanted. It's a must.Besoin Primairewww.besoinprimaire.com",Oberlo,Shopify
3,,This app has a blurred and hesitant appearance when giving out pertinent information one needs to complete and fully understand the info it's revealing.,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"This is a great app for a beginning business. The free plan until you reach 50 sales per is great because it allows you to hit the floor running - not many apps available that will allow you full functionality when they can charge, even when you have not yet made a profit. It is very easy to use and offers information on cost to you, suggested price as per the industry standard (MSRP would be nice), and several areas and features to make it easy to individualize the prices on your choice items. Rapid response of staff is a plus. The ability to have the items in two groups, ""import list"" and ""my products"" makes it easy to review items. It also has the added benefit of allowing for review/edit/proofing before sending it to your store.Downside is lack of uniformity on product information, lack of information as pertains to manufacturers, brands, models (this is helpful to increase credibility and homogenize the look and feel of your store), not all products offered have the ""View product on AliExpress"" link (incredibly helpful when reviewing an item to add to your store, since sometimes the descriptions are more comprehensive on the original site than the ones offered, which makes it easier to edit/proof the product description).I would like to see them add a comments and review function on the products in our dashboard that only we would see so that we know if we've previously seen/researched the item. When reviewing many products, eventually your eyes go screwy.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Cut to the summary - install it and move on.  This app is so good.  We have run with it for a few weeks now and feel completely comfortable with it.  Absolutely, a no-brainer for importing from Ali...not just Oberlo approved suppliers but all and any product in an instant.  ePacket shipping identification - excellent.  Product splitting - excellent. Global price adjustment - excellent*.  Auto-price update - you can't run a store without it (unless you are selling only a handful of products) - again, excellent.  Order fulfillment and integration with Ali shipping notifications, and onward integration with Shopify (and your customers) - excellent.  This is a must-have app. *Our only disappointment is that Oberlo can't handle AUD dollars right now.  Imports from Ali into Oberlo are in USD $.  If your currency is not supported by Oberlo then you need to adjust the global pricing multipliers accordingly and also keep an eye on what your currency is worth against the USD $.",Oberlo,Shopify
2,,I use this app to acquire inventory on my Shopify site.  While there are many good products there are a few major issues I am facing.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"This app is a shame. I had several issues with them (appart the 10 e-mails you will receive a day, even if you want to unsubscribe...):1. They will never give you reports (except one which is totally useless)2. They can refuse to add some aliexpress product, and this without any explication, just because they don't want to!!!!",Oberlo,Shopify

1,,"Such a horrible experience using this app. I tested out a few items from Orbelo in my newly launched shop and when customers ordered they didn't receive 2 of the 3 items and the one that came in looked NOTHING like the item described from the Verified seller.

Their lack of meaningful response and solution has prevented me from launching my site to the public as everything as of now has to be done manually in terms of order syncing and tracking uploads.

1,,"The support team doesnt answer the questions. I wrote them like 4 emails, but i dont have a reply. The support sucks!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,I love the integration with Shopify and the ability to leverage the Google Chrome Extension with AliExpress. Importing products from AliExpress into my store via Oberlo is a very quick and easy process. I actually wish the Shopify screens to update products was as easy as it is inside Oberlo.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Easy set up a fantastic interface and overall app!,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"I like how simple it is to use. With a few updates especially wording, you cN have a nice inventory. I do not like how you can reach an import limit so fast so i'm trying to delete some inventory and start over basically to get the exact product line i need.",Oberlo,Shopify

5,,Great App. Very easy to use!! Highly recommended,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Would definitely recommend, does it's job well!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,I think this app is one of the best. You can add the Oberlo plugin to Google Chrome for add products directly from Aliexpress to your import list.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I currently pay for the middle subscription. It's only good to upload products to your store. Autofill works half of the time. I recommend finding another application. Items always out of sync (it's not from ali changing products). I requested to speak with someone on the phone and they denied me. Ali show items are in stock, however, Oberlo shows out of stock. This causes my store to lose money (while i'm running ads). They try to do the standard troubleshooting but its something with the add on. Never can get a clear answer on how this can be fixed.",Oberlo,Shopify
2,,So far bunch of stuff they don't tell you. You have to do your research,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Awesome app: very easy to use. Products pull very well, selecting photos is easy",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,can't go wrong with oberlo.. one of the best apps for dropshipping.. but it's missing a lot of features that I wish they can add in future when it comes to importing your stuff,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,LOVE how easy dropshipping is with this app integration with shopify. My only wish is that there were more products available with oberlo supply. Great app!,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Makes it so easy to import products.,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,I absolutely love this app and makes everything really smooth. I'm giving 4 stars because sometimes it does not integrate with sales and I have to go and manually go in and put the customers info and stuff. Then after I am done ordering and talking with supplier it all of a sudden syncs with shopify after I have done all the work. Don't really know what's going on. Luckily it was only for one order that had 2 items. Great app tho!,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"been using this to push my products since the day i got it. only downside about the app is, not user friendly at the beginning, gets confusing but love it overall",Oberlo,Shopify

No notifications. No email updates. No communication until I reached out asking what was going on.,Oberlo,Shopify

1,,"Was great at first, until I got my first order. Took 3-4 weeks for customer to receive their item. i had to refund the costumer as the quality of the product(clothing) was terrible and looked nothing like the photo. When I started a dispute on Oberlo, the seller said they didn't see anything wrong with the product and that they would do better in the future. No apologies, nothing. I lost money on my first two sales because of them. After that I deleted Oberlo and took the plunge into buying my own inventory.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Oberlo is quite amazing. Especially if you're looking to grow your business from nothing. Setting up is simple, video tutorials tell you all you need know to fire up your new online store.

2,,"I was really excited when I first started using this app for my store. A majority of my products were from Oberlo and they made everything simple and easy. However, when you try to edit a product in Oberlo before importing it to the store, most of the changed you made, especially in the tags, will not transfer to the store. So, you have to edit the product again after it is imported. Also, if there is a problem with a product never arriving, it is impossible to receive any kind of help on the issue. I had a product never arrive, even after 4 months. I contacted Oberlo for help but they never responded and the tracking number given for the product showed up with no results. Since then, I have removed every Oberlo product from my store and only use Oberlo to import AliExpress items because I can talk directly to vendors with AliExpress. I recommend the app only to add AliExpress items; do not use it to sell Oberlo Supply items.",Oberlo,Shopify

1,,Stay away from this app at all cost.  They connect you to scam artists on AliExpress who provide knockoffs of brand names.  Not being familiar with these brands I stupidly trusted these vendors.  They ruined my company reputation that I spent 3 years to build.  I have been harassed for days being called every name in the book and accused of stealing other brands products as my own.  When I contacted them about it they had no remorse and just forwarded me some links to stupid articles.,Oberlo,Shopify

5,,My partner and I have been on this site for only a few hours and we were very skeptical about the types of products that we would find so we started to search name brand items that we currently buy elsewhere and we were happy to find about 80% of what we shop for was on this site.

5,,Perfect for adding gifts to your current product offerings.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Oberlo forces you to go Pro (79/month) to use the Aliexpress affliate program because they want to pocket that cashback. don't think that's fair. we are already paying at least $29/month if our store is making over 50 sales a month.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,We use Oberlo for our hippie clothes and sweatshirt dress & more at https://peacefulstore.com This app is a complete solution for dropshipping.https://peacefulstore.com/collections/frontpage/products/sweatshirt-dress,Oberlo,Shopify

5,,You won't find an easier way to start dropshipping business. Highly recommended for starters,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"So after getting an order my customer decided that the size was wrong for a certain product they ordered so they wanted refund. I refunded this order and this was all within a couple hours. I then asked for a refund through oberlo, to get a message from there support team telling me since the supplier is over seas they cannot refund my product and its already sent out. Really? Within a few hours im sure, so now im out the money and the customer will get a free shirt thanks oberlo much appreciated now i see how hard it will actually be to deal with a middle man.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,really easy to use ! importing item from aliexpress to oberlo to the store works great. I did a test order through my store and everything works perfectly. Very happy with it so far,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Great. Helps make a dropshipping website extremely easily plus has tons of helpful tools.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,I love this app! Makes finding things to sell so easy!,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"This is a great app.  Hope they decide to leave it the way it is, and not screw it up like most developers do.  Works great just the way it is.  Would be nice if they did add a few different platforms other than Aliexpress, but all in all it's a great app.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Awesome and easy to use! Highly Recommended!,Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"TERRIBLE Customer support.  Plan on waiting for a day or more if something goes wrong.  In my case, a customer purchased a product and a week later I received a refund from the supplier with no explanation.  Now I have to deal with a customer who won't be getting the product ordered.",Oberlo,Shopify
2,,"Great app, keep in mind you still have to do things manually but that´s pretty normal. BAD POINTS for the Support. Customer service is not very responsive, waiting more than two days already for an answer.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Awesome product Highly recommended,Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"Setting things up is easy, but once you get to the CRITICAL stage of accepting customer orders, things start falling apart. Customer service is not very responsive, nor helpful. Their tutorials are not helpful. And when trying to fulfill the orders, the process is extremely manual and prone to errors. For example, I received two orders in one day. When I fulfilled one order, I had to enter my own email and phone number for the customer? And then when I went to pay with my own credit card, the customer's shipping address is used as my billing address? Someone is going to get a call from my credit card company or the card is going to be frozen...this is ridiculous. And then, going to fulfill the second order, Oberlo's chrome extension automatically added all of the products from the first client's order to the order of the second client and there's no way to reverse it. This is horrible and sloppy. If you plan on operating a dropshipping business at high scale, this is not the app to choose.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Store has been up for about a week but so far so good. Importing items has been very easy without having to edit too much information.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Very late responses from the customer support. Almost always not online. They respond after you have solved the problem alone or you have lost the client.,Oberlo,Shopify
2,,"This app is one piece of torture app , becarefull if you have 2 or more stores, because this app will mess u app, mess ur store app, make u do your work 2 or 3 times, this app have amazing interface and CRAPPY user experience. yah, it changed the face of drop shipping from ali-express, but only because there were no one else when they started.Not only that, their development is so slow, hardly developing. only focusing on re-target your ass after they already own it. what a waist of money.the only awesome thing about this app is the fact that its free up to 500 items.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Best.  App.  Ever.  I use it for all of my drop shipped products, and I wouldn't have such a large inventory without Oberlo.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Any app linked too Aliexpress SUCKS! My customers for the most part had to wait almost 30 days for them to receive any item.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Thank you, this app is a lifesaver .",Oberlo,Shopify

3,,"Ordered a blouse for my wife as a test product. Arrived all crumbled in a tiny bag. After Ironing it did fit, so sizing guide okay, but then it shrank after the first wash. All in All not good value for money. I would be expecting a lot of returns, so it's not for me. These were supposed to be Oberlo vetted products. Order processing and integration is great, they just need to source better products.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"As an App Oberlo is working fine, but Not recommend to use because of they customer service. It is very dificult to rich them and when they answer just send you some articles that you need to spend hour reading.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Really good solution !I am currently making a lot of money using this. To use Ali Express, sign up through the link below and get 30% cash back always. Is not it really amazing? I'm actually getting 30% cash back always.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"This is a very good app. I have 3 shops and Oberlo is essential if you want to grow your dropshipping business. It is very easy to use and it is very stable. One wish that I hope to be fulfilled soon: the ability to find more suppliers from USA. Thanks! John, freshhomeguide.com",Oberlo,Shopify

5,,"Using this to sell Christmas Gifts, love how simple it is.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Love this app!Really easy to use and syncs well with aliexpress.,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"This is actually a great app, but there are a few issues that I was not aware of until I stumbled acrossed it. The biggest issue is that my store is in Australia, which means I run off of AUD prices. I wanted to set the prices so that i would make 7 dollars off each item, and figured oberlo could handle it. I was wrong. I did not find this out until I did a test order and found that the product I had tested was only going to net me 2 dollars.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Since my online store is available 24X7 I expect my vendors to support their site 24X7 also. Here it is Sunday night and I can't get a question answered.,Oberlo,Shopify
2,,"Alibaba is a better site to find good products to sell! I just need to find a free app that supports Alibaba. To use Oberlo correctly you have to go to Aliexpress use their search engine find what you want if they have it that is! then copy the url paste it in the url search in Oberlo then you can then add the product to your store! With Alibaba you search for what you want and what you are probably looking for will probably be on the first page. Yes, I have tried chatting with Oberlo on their site but nothing changes. When you ask for help you will get a long wind response on how to get what you need done! When the help that you need can be answered in 2 or 3 sentences!",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I was happy with Oberlo until things went wrong, as in wrong in a major way. DO NOT export products from Shopify and then reimport the list because Oberlo throws a fit and basically you have to redo everything, so 800 products and 4200 variants later we are repeating all of the work that we had to do to set the site up in the first place.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"So far, this has been a very useful and easy product to use. My store just went live today, so I haven't had the opportunity to place an order with it, but my testing was seamless.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,One of the best aps to use for your dropshipping business I used it for vix market and it blew my mind how easy it is to use,Oberlo,Shopify

1,,This app was awesome until Oberlos greed got to them! you cant import URLs anymore so you are forced to buy their overpriced wholesale crap! im so dissapointed!,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Complete crap app. They removed option to import a product by url now its impossible to sync if you have multiple stores in different countries. What a stupid decision to make equals newbie company,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Excellent and Easy to use App.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Excellent and easy to use but very pricey with the comparison to its possibilities.The biggest minus is for its limited number of items and orders.So, I decided to try Expressify, it has unlimited number of uploads.Have to try it.Other apps I tried have no chance to compare to Oberlo.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Amazing app! Very easy to use, and it makes listing and logistics a breeze!",Oberlo,Shopify

5,,Great app! Good work by the developers. Thanks,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Great App For Adding Products! Fire Sale Approved!,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"So far the experience using the app has been great! It is well integrated with both Shopify and AliExpress. In addition, the articles and blog are very useful. One improvement would be to add the shipping weight of each product automatically from Ali. It is found in the product details and should be easily extracted when importing products to Shopify. Thanks!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"I could not use Shopify without Oberlo, PERIOD!In fact I found Oberlo just before I was ready to create something similar of my own, in order to automate as much of the process as possible. Thankfully there was no need to do that, since Oberlo already not only existed, but was doing many things that I wanted to have in my automation of Shopify. I've read some negative reviews and truly think these are either clueless noobs or competitors, although I haven't found a plugin and platform that comes even close to what Oberlo does. It does miss a few things that I would like to have in terms of usability and user interface, but the overall experience is so good, that I will not be surprised if Shopify actually buys Oberlo in the future and merges it in the backend. It is THAT seamless. I frequently talk with their customer support, and they are very helpful and provide lots of tips. Of course don't expect with so many thousands of people using the tool to get an answer the very next minute (although I do) but I have to say that all the negative things I've read are simply BS. I buy from Aliexpress with my own affiliate link, and not only Oberlo doesn't get the commission, but they've even got to the length to help me set it up, and I've seen the commissions already in my Paypal account. There are very few things that I would add, mostly in terms of usability like having a list view, and some other features that I've already talked about with them, and I'm pretty sure they will add them soon. If you take software and business automation seriously and have common sense to not believe some bozo whiners in the comments, do your self a favor and use Oberlo as soon as you setup your store. I use the expensive subscription since we have over 10,000 products and its worth every penny. Trust me, I'm in the business for almost 3 decades and a developer. You can't pay for such tool and the support behind it. Go ahead and try to build some serious business automation and see how much it costs. Surely they can do better as they grow along with Shopify, but I challenge you to go back a decade and see how crappy all the e-commerce software solutions were back then. We are very close to automate EVERYTHING in our process and our business in general, and Oberlo is a major part of that. If you are still doing a bunch of manual work in your e-commerce website, you are not taking your time seriously. Use money, people and automation to save your time, otherwise you are not a business person, but an employee of a job that you've created just to fool your self that you don't have a boss. The first step for freedom comes with a business that runs without YOU. That's what Oberlo does for me, to the extend that it can so far, as part of my overall strategy to be free.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Shipping times are insane and could not get anyone to help me,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Literally, the worst company i have ever worked with. Their credit card processing is all screwed up and their customer support is ZERO. I have been trying to contact them for DAYS and I cant get a single helpful response because their customer service people are somewhere abroad that BARELY speak any english. I highly recommend staying sway from them and if you want a dropshipping company that does what they do, there are plenty more on the shopify app store. Stay away from Oberlo if you actually want your business to succeed.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,they block supplier`s account and take the money away.,Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"I have been using Oberlo since June/July and so far it was great and super easy to use! However, when I finally received some orders, Oberlo didn't seem to fully sync with Shopify. Perfect example, if you offer a discount in Shopify, it does not discount it in Oberlo. You will have to pay the difference out of pocket. If you make this mistake like I did, then all you will get is an apology....maybe. Also, My current situation is I received 2 orders within 24-48 from the same person. One of the orders recently processed and shipped within the 2-4 Day time window. Great! I was excited, I felt like everything was going fine. I've been patiently waiting and monitoring my Oberlo Dashboard to see if my second order has processed and to my surprise, it has not been touched. It has now been 6 days and the order is paid but has not been fulfilled. I decided to contact support (There is no phone support) through email and I can not get a reply. I contacted Shopify and they couldn't even get a reply from Oberlo. Shopify told me to look on Ali Express to find my orders and to contact the supplier but none of my orders appear on Ali Express and the supplier that I have purchased from (APEX TRADING) doesn't even exist. They don't even exist on AliBaba. The only solution that the Shopify Guru could give me was to wait until Monday and if my order haven't shipped, cancel the order and refund my customer! This is terrible and I have to give my trusting customers information that I don't even have!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Oberlo  is working execelent and easy so far. Paulius always ready to help , really 5 star. Thank you for this app !",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"The app is easy to use and developed well. Happy to see free account too, so we can test before we invest into it.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Would have given it a 5 star rating until, I found out that they are using their affiliate link to take the client's deserved cashback for their own greedy selves. I was soon to get to 50 orders a month, and was planning to change to a paid plan but this is a huge deal breaker for me. No respect for your customers equals no trust. Going to migrate to a much better and honest competitor.",Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"Firstly id like to say this is an amazingly built app. It makes sourcing products, dealing with suppliers, tracking numbers etc a breeze. I actually can't fault it from that perspective. The main issue i have is that it is not compatible with Shopify Payments. Due to the increased risk of chargebacks with dropshipping from China (long delivery times etc) the chargebacks risk is increased and as such Shopify have placed a 25% escrow on each transaction held for 90 days i.e. we only get 75% of the order value.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Good shit. Wondering where y'all have been,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,"Frankly I have a college degree from a prestigious university in the United States including other courses in law, but I must tell you although I have not tested Oberlo's Drop Shipping App which I am getting into now, the way he breaks down Drop Shipping information inspire me immensely and has given me hope of success in my eCommerce business endeavor. I will be the first to blow horn to other ecommerce guys to try out Oberlo after my first sale. He is indeed a true businessman with style.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Thanks a lot, everything is still working great!! Check it out in action here!!:https://www.exoticknifescales.com",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Awesome App Guys Keep Improving <3,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Fantastic app, works exactly as described. Installing was easy. Well worth it.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,I am leaving Oberlo mainly because their customer service is so slow in response!  I was messaging them at least once a week with an issue or a glitch and would get responses like a few days later.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Wow! A++ thank so much for this app! Oberlo is Amazing! I'm amazed at how fluid and seamless this app is. I can see that a lot of thought was put into making features that actually work. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone on Shopify. We look forward to seeing more apps come from y’all!,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,So many more stars than 5 are deserved! This app is a dropshipping lifesaver! So easy for me to place orders each day with very few clicks. Take the time to play with the settings so pricing is automatically updated and stock is updated if a listing disappears. A must-have if you plan on dropshipping!!,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Great product that massively streamlines dropshipping - could do with extra product editing options prior to import though.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Enjoy using the app! It was a great help for first-timer in the e-commerce business and it does help to streamline products between aliexpress and my website. Save my time to import and help to keep track of products! Helps to navigate products easily in my website.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Horrible customer service. I lost money using this app and now all of my products are linked through them so I have to continue using them. Don't recommend.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Tracking numbers dont lead anywhere and customer service is hit and miss.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Used it once when I first installed it.  I couldn't get right back to it, so i had to try to remember what i had done.  I couldn't get back into any of the settings to verify, couldn't totally delete either the app or the Chrome extension.  Just kept being sent to the dashboard over and over again.  A horrid product, STAY AWAY!!!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Awesome app and would recommend it to everyone,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Oberlo as a software is great, it makes things more simple and life easier.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Used Oberlo for a month and Shopify put a hold on my Shopify Payment account.  Hopefully, I'll be able to use their Payment system but no decision was made yet.  Maybe I didn't read the finer fine print but deleting Oberlo did not reactivate anything.",Oberlo,Shopify
3,,Getting any support takes days so my first score was one star. I have changed my score as requested by Oberlo but will not give a better score until support improves. I do not need 24/7 support but at least some help with in a day when issues come up. I had been having problems with simple log in and only way to fix with no support was to deleted the app from shopify and reinstall. I had to do this twice in two weeks!,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Amazing app that every shopify shop should have. Easy to add products from aliexpress, which saves a lot of time than adding products manually.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Amigo eu não estou conseguindo  abrir o oberlo através do shopify tem com vocês  mim ajudar. Não sei o que esta acontecendo,Oberlo,Shopify

1,,"Horrible customer service. They had a supplier named Kimmyshop in their special ""Oberlo Supply"" list. I had to make some adjustments to my store and I deleted some of my products. Went to add them again and the supplier is no longer listed! I was never sent an e-mail telling me that they would now longer be on the site. I e-mailed customer support four days ago and none has gotten back to me to explain what is going on. Brutal Service",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,This app is a life saver I am very pleased with it. Thank you !,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,They stopped allow you to use your own affiliate links or cashback plugins without previous warning. So we can conclude that they receive the cashback from our sales without warning us.,Oberlo,Shopify

5,,Great app for drop shippers. Thanks - https://gadgetbums.com,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Great app. Easy to use. Love it.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,I have used Oberlo for about 2 weeks now and finally made my first sale! I was going to wait until that happened to comment on the app in order to be able to write a well versed review.  This app is very easy to use and offers a wide range of tools to make our shop self sustaining. This is probably our number 1 favorite app we use here at Clover Brand Outdoor Supply Co.,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,Great app! Make sure you check my website if you read my review :)) Thanks! www.chapter94.com  -  Only one thing... when I select to not add a item on my website the photos of product are still upload on my website so I need to delete it or to deselect them manual.. this can be done I think automatically...,Oberlo,Shopify

5,,Looks really great! Useful and clean app. 5 Stars,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Awesome app, the best i ever seen, and free also. very very good work guys.thank you.",Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"I really like the way that the chrome extension made it extremely easy to import products from Ali Express. I really don't have any complaints about the app or the service provided by Oberlo. My problem was that after using Oberlo to add products to my store, I got a message from Shopify payments saying that because my products were sourced from China, they were going to put a 25% hold on all purchases because of issues with charge backs from customers purchasing items from China. They mentioned that US customers expect fast shipping times and the 2 weeks or longer for products to arrive result in several orders being refunded. I planned on making it very clear what the expectations for shipping should be, but the 25% hold was not something I wanted to deal with. So, I ended up removing the app and sourcing from only US sellers. Again, the app is great, but unfortunately unusable for my situation. It's not Oberlo's fault and I'm sorry it didn't work out.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Very good. Permits to gain time : easily add products in your shop and order the product in one click,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,A nice solution to contacting the manufacturers directly,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,A little pricey but gets the job done. Also they need to allow auto fulfillment of more than 1 supplier for each product.,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,Great app to get products on your site quickly!,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Super application! Très facile d'utilisation! Un must!!!,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,HANDS DOWN This is the best app ever. It makes everything super easy and efficient. Great app! Would recommend to everyone.,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I would not recommend using Oberlo. First, I was ordering on Ali Express through Oberlo and my account was locked. Oberlo should warn people that this will happen, so i stopped using Ali Express. I then decided to use only Oberlo Supply suppliers and products as they say they ""vet"" the products for quality, etc.  The quality of the shirts were horrible! Strings hanging off of the shirts and VERY VERY thin material.  Next, the shipping is HORRIBLE!!! I have had tracking numbers expire, orders cancelled on me without any notice of the cancellation and it's taking around 3+ weeks for products to be delivered. We way $2 for ePacket delivery and products take nearly a month to arrive. I have gotten FREE ePacket delivery using DHGate and even Ali Express when I was using it and the products arrived in less than 2 weeks! I think Oberlo Supply is misleading and Oberlo does not hold their suppliers accountable. I would not recommend this app at all. If I could give a 0 star rating I would",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Excellent app! It's allowed us to add related items to our store without having to buy stock etc. I think this is a musty have app,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,I am green to e-Commerce but with app it gives me the confidence I need to be successful as quick as possible.  I've learned a TON in the last few days and have quickly started offering items in a few hours.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,THANK YOU OBERLO ... I LOVE YOU!.. GOD BLESS YOU! 4EVER,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Allows me to order products with one click, definitely cuts down the amount of time I spend on the business significantly.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"Communication was good, but they do nothing else but adding and removing the products. I have to keep tracking which products was deleted so i delete them from my shop too. After all of editing of bad english of the products, i now must delete them. 2 days after the addition, half of my products must be deleted.Removing app, brining site down..I guess Oberlo is not something i can rely.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"I would give zero stars if I could. Oberlo does some of what it says, but their pricing is misleading, moreover, their customer support team is a complete joke. They have canned copy/paste responses that do nothing but irritate you. Once expressing the desire for some personal and real support, they added more text and copy/pasted their support answered again!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Great App!  Totally recommended,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,My initial review after fully setting up my store is 5-stars. The ease of getting things setup and processing orders is incredible. I even made several mistakes in setting up the Shopify side when fulfilling only through Oberlo and Oberlo live chat (built into the app) was quick to tell me exactly how to resolve it.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,one of the best apps for shopify auto import products..i wish they could give more items in the free version since now shopify aquire them,Oberlo,Shopify

4,,I started my first drop shipping store selling kids watches in New Zealand from www.kidswatches.co.nz Oberlo has made this really easy so far. One feature that would make it even better is if you could customise the shipping information that goes to Shopify. At the moment it just picks up the default shipping Company in Shopify. I need to choose Other and enter a cutom url.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Great tool. One appreciate it even more after dealing with the sites that don't support any tools and everything should be done manually.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Awesome app, easy to use, fantastic support, and  make your work so easy and time saving. We recommend everyone to use it.",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,"The app has several glitches. Crashes a lot when fulfilling orders. However, usually, I just reload the screen a few times and the Oberlo app usually works after a while. If you can deal with how slow the app is, then its fine. Though severely overpriced! My main issue with this app is the customer service. I came to them with an issue that STILL hasn't been resolved. They make promises they definitely can't keep and put very little effort into fixing issues in the app. Still, the app tells me I have the wrong number of orders to be fulfilled. It is correct in Shopify so I rely solely on it to give me the number of orders I have unfulfilled.",Oberlo,Shopify
4,,This app is great. It saves you a ton of time rather than importing products manually.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,its great very helpful i like it,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,FIVE STARS all the way!! Can hardly believe it's free. Excellent support.Def recommend,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"An Ecommers' Dream!!! Great time and money saving app! Not only do you gain access to thousands of suppliers, but the product images, details and prices are all situated right there for you.

I ordered hats, electric lighters, clothes, etc off of ebay during Chinese New Year.  So I paid double for the product to keep customers happy.  I requested the orders be cancelled on AliExpress and the factories disregarded and sent the product anyway.  None of this was Oberlo's fault, but they do not do enough to let drop shippers know just how bad the Chinese New Year is for drop ship sellers.  It last three weeks.  They shut down their entire post office in China one week before CNY, so you aren't getting anything shipped for a month.  Customers don't understand that.  So my customers during CNY got two of everything they ordered.",Oberlo,Shopify

The follow-up emails instructing you on how to proceed after your first couple of sales is a great feature as well. - www.DigTheFalls.com",Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"This app is NOT FULLY AUTOMATIC! You'll have to use your personal funds to actually purchase the products before shopify pays you.  Theres no wallet, no paypal, nothing but a credit card to purchase the orders your customers have made. So if you have 10k in orders today, your going to have to pull out your credit card, actually purchase the product FIRST! So if you dont have 10k to purchase and fulfill the product, then your customers have to wait until shopify releases the money therefore giving your customers slow shipping and fulfillment. Then shipment goes out. I just felt like this needed to be known up front instead of loading this app just to start making sells to find out you have to use your personally funds.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Very USEFUL! Simple and Easy. TIME SAVER!!!!,Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"Oberlo is a great idea and program, but it needs to be improved in some points. For example, pictures are almost always duplicated when publishing a product and you can't delete them manually, so you have to save and upload them all again. It also often completely deletes pictures, tags or variants.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Very easy to edit in bulk, I love the fact that the variations of the products are perfect!! I dont have to edit each TShirt that have 9 different colors & 5 different sizes & different prices! It take less than 2 minutes to edit then push to my shop! Without Oberlo I went from having 10 products for sale Now with Oberlo I have over 400!!!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Big Time Saver. Makes SO much more possible on Shopify.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Awesome time saving app and support is very friendly,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,One of the best app in shopify,Oberlo,Shopify
4,,The app is awesome but it is ridiculous that you have to go to a desktop computer to place your orders because ordering doesn't work in the Android cell phone environment.  This is a must fix.  4 stars for now.,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Life saver! This app makes your life easier and more profitable!,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Great app.  Saves me tons of time by automating processes that would normally take hours.  This is a must have for any site handing ""drop shipping"".",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,I just received my first order and I can't add it to my aliexpress shopping cart.  I am going to have to manually enter all information.  Not useful :(,Oberlo,Shopify

5,,Excellent. Easy to use and whenever I had any questions they got back to me right away. Very friendly and helpful support staff. Thank you!,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,I have had 2 items sent as not as described.  I have filed 1 claim and have gotten no response about the claim and now I have had my CC # stolen after using it on their site.  Deliveries are late and many vendors are selling items that they are not supposed to be selling and i have had US companies tell me I am not authorized to sell items.  You cannot grow your own business if you use this company.,Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"Its impossible for me to order anything on ali express, now i have to upload tons of documents. Its no big deal to me, because i can find real dropship suppliers all day long. I do not need this middle man crap anyways.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,I will use Oberlo again and recommend it to a friend? This is great product and very efficient.  It really saves time setting up your shop,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,just the best of it's category,Oberlo,Shopify
5,,GREAT APP . easy to use www.novaboxing.com,Oberlo,Shopify
3,,"This app is well built with a convenient interface and even works perfect. BUT if you are looking to add a lot of items on a daily/weekly base it is impossible!You create & edit your import list easily and once you done, you import it to your store; the app moves your imported products to another tab and you can create a new import list. The problem is that there is no sync between the imported products to the import list, meaning you can add the same product twice (or more). I realize it when I already had 400 products 'live'. The data must sync, I'm not going to check if I already imported every product I want to add?! I hope the team will find a solution soon :-( so I could upgrade my plan.It is a super important feature for a massive import, therefore 3 stars, otherwise, this app deserves 10 star!",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Brilliant. Simple to use and very cheap. We use it as an addition to original products on Baristaswag.com,Oberlo,Shopify

It's one of those things I wish existed a few years back when I was using wordpress + woocommerce because it would have made a huge difference. Not only does it make it easier to import products, images, and descriptions (I don't suggest using the descriptions cause the Chinese have a bad grasp on grammar)... it makes fulfillment end much more of a breeze! Including getting the tracking information! The whole process reminds me of an advanced imacro that I could not have done myself. Anyways... because things are scaling up quickly, soon the responsibilities will be transferred to a VA which will make their life easier too! Again, it's going to save time & money!",Oberlo,Shopify

I have a note saved to my supplier, and click, click, click and I have an order placed!  It is so easy.  Oh, not really so sure how many clicks, it may only be one or two, but you know what I mean.  Even a monkey could do it!  Ooh Ooh eeh eeh aah aah!  That's me!  lol  enjoy it!",Oberlo,Shopify
1,,What people don't realise is that every time we process an order through oberlo they are receiving an affiliate commission. So they are charging a monthly fee as well as collecting affiliate commissions from aliexpress. Not to mention the app is glitchy the wrong product images always seem to get into my other listings and every time I go to aliexpress to look for products I get products being automatically added to my cart every time I view a product! I would not recommend this app. If you are thinking about downloading this app don't. These people are sneaky and greedy!,Oberlo,Shopify

5,,100/100 SCORE!! Absolutely wouldn't want any other system to help with my Shopify site. The entire staff is very thoughtful and understanding of your needs as a retail distributor. I've only had my Shopify store up for less than week and this program had helped me upload more than 900 products so far!! SUPERB program! Trying dropshipping in the past had always led to failure due to the issues this program has completely automated for you at your fingertips! I recommend this program to anyone starting out new or even dropshipping veterans just looking for a program to automate your product importing. I've never been so relieved. Thank you for everything Oberlo!       -Eric R Johnston,Oberlo,Shopify

Buyer and order details are automatically transferred and Ali Express order details are synced back to Oberlo making tracking of sales so easy.  Added to this their customer support is one of the best I have used, and great when you have questions when you are starting to use the app for the first time.  Well worth the money.",Oberlo,Shopify

5,,We'er just wondering why Shopify isn't implementing a special way or making an exception for rating an extraordinary app and a developer with more than 5 stars because this app and it's developers just simply deserves it.

4,,"This software runs pretty smooth, I can only give it a 4 star because like everything and, there is always room for improvement. But overall the importing is very simple and easy, the chrome extension is a huge help to sourcing products efficiently.

We would recommend this to plenty of other e-commerce businesses which are looking to quickly source from Aliexpress.",Oberlo,Shopify

5,,"This App is a must have if you want to get your listing done in a blink of an eye,I just love this app go get it",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,"Tomas is super helpful, once I had this set up and running it saves HOURS of work and it is amazingly fast and simple to use. Fully customizable as you bring in products to remove text and edits, before publishing to your stores, and easy drop ship fulfillment as the app goes to AliExpress and BUYS the product, fills in the customers address info for you. All you gotta do is push the button and it's fulflled and wait for tracking #s. Once a tracking # is issued - again, just push a button and tracking is synced to your Shopify dashboard and email gets sent to customer with the tracking link and they are happy, we are happy, every one is happy.",Oberlo,Shopify

1,,"Massively overpriced for what the product actually does. Hasn't really helped speed up the process at all of importing products from AliExpress. Looks like the app will improve with time, and I would be willing to give it another go. But for now the 29.90 price tag is just plain greedy.",Oberlo,Shopify
5,,Era muy necesaria una app como esta para AliExpress. Enhorabuena !! la vamos a dar a conocer. Conocemos a miles de personas que les encantara!,Oberlo,Shopify
1,,Slow. Doesn't import a lot of products.,Oberlo,Shopify

5,,So far so good. Very simple to link and import products. Options to modify data and images being pushed to store. Love it!,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"This platform is worthless. They do not have any hot selling items that can be sourced in the USA with fast shipping. They take too long to process orders for them to be shipped out efficiently. The upgrading plans are just a money grab. Even at the highest level plan the items are still not hot selling products. The have a less than 25 items per category that are deemed ""Premium"". Most of the items are Drop Shipped off of Aliexpress at a higher cost price compare to this platform. I have done my research and can say that this platform is a complete waste of your time to even try out.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Awesome app. I downloaded and have implemented it to my store. Already added a couple of items. Can’t wait to see the outcome.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Very nice app! Most products have good product descriptions on them saving a TON of time. It still could improve on it's optimization of it's search engine. You can only narrow your search so much with the current search engine and it requires you to scroll quite a bit to find a good product this bad design actually does sometimes help with finding new products though :) Also would like to be able to change the picture that is displayed when the product is on sale from within the app. Also if you accidently make a mistake and push your product to your page and then you go to the products you imported there is no way to unpush the product and fix it. You have to do it from Shopify otherwise Spocket will delete your product. There may be a way around this I've only been using the app for a couple of hours but I know Dropified doesn't have this issue. Overall from what I've seen the app does way more right than it does wrong. Really awesome and excited to use it more.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"So far so good! The Spocket app has made things easier, from search (although the search engine should be optimized), to the variety of products, the quality and app integration with Shopify. I might update this review down the road, but so far it has worked well for me.",Spocket,Shopify

4,,"Pretty nice! Needs more variety on dresses though, doesn't really have the modern fashion on the app.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,very helpful so far and love that suppliers are US based. Still in the free trial but very optimistic based on what the experience so far.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I just started using this app, so far I am happy with it. I've imported a few items to my store so far, was very simple. I'm praying this will help bring more sales to my Boutique without the hassle of having on hand since my store is an online Boutique. I will say I was a bit disappointed that there is not a good selection of Mens Clothing, nor the styles of womens that I already carry.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,i love this app and the products they help me to supply in my store are quality and cute products for all my buyers needs. I hope everyone has a good experience as I did,Spocket,Shopify

5,,I used this app to help my business and so far it has been great. I wouldn't change anything about it.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I have to admit, Spocket deserves praise. What convinced me to work with Spocket was the fact that you can find a huge number of suppliers from the United States and Europe, which means quality, and the fact that Spocket issues invoices on my company. However, I would come up with the proposal that in the ""Import List"" or ""My Products"" to have the opportunity to create catalogs, it would be easier to organize the products, but anyway, 5 stars for Spocket.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Definitely one of the best suppliers out there not only would i recommend, id argue spocket is a must for people starting off dropshipping",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Easy to use, fast and perfect for products that you want to sell to customers, and connect products with one click.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Spocket is a good first time e-commerce starter. I would recommend Spocket to anyone that does not want to handle the inventory themselves.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Spocket is so much easier than the other stores. I have multple dropshipping businesses and I now will be using Spocket more often.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,A very nice and easy to use App! It is very simple to integrate and import products to the store. Product ordering is also very much easier.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Selecting and pushing products to my store was pretty easy. I also like that they have two different payment options.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I wouldn't even give this app one star. The app is a great idea but execution is exceptionally poor. [Huge opportunity for someone to develop a similar app that actually works with good customer service!!!]. Speaking of customer service it is simply atrocious. Rarely helpful, often I was left on chats waiting for up to 30 minutes with no response. I had to always follow-up to see if someone was there. They just disappear and stop responding if they can't help (I don’t think those at customer service have actually used the app themselves in real life scenarios; they assume the answer is always something basic and simple but I’m long past understanding the basics of the app, I’m having real issues placing customer orders; it’s also always your fault – never theirs). Some great products on the app, especially for Canadian sellers, but the app in terms of integrating with Shopify, tracking inventory, placing orders never worked (I’m supposed to do a manual fix for an issue – so what’s the point of the app and the fee??!!). I spent more time and hassle then this app is worth (in terms of the profit you can make on items, the work involved in using the app and interacting with customer service and especially given its annual cost; even with the app being cumbersome and unintuitive and basically not working they won’t give refunds – beware). Steer clear. I'd be happy to chat with anyone about my experience with the app. Feel free to reach out to me via my store.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Very nice app not complicated to setup in my store. I was able to select a plan and push products to my store within minutes.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,A Very Nice App! It is very simple to use. I was able to choose a plan and select a great products.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I am happy to be back with Spocket. My inexperience and impatince did not allow me to truly use Spocket resourcefully. Will not happen again..,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I Love this app, Very much easier experience than oberlo, and high quality products with fast shipping, this will help my business!",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I love the fact that the SKU numbers port over. That's a time-saver. Good products and great prices. Now if they could do away with the membership fee, it would be GOLD.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,They are speedy in communicating with you. Easily to navigate or integrate products to your website. very quality product,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"It's honestly not worth the price in my opinion. Falsely advertised shipping times. There is no way to directly contact distributors. You will actually notice there are many dropshippers already on this platform selling products at ridiculous prices compared to market. Many of the distributors do not update their inventory correctly, or update order status at all. I would be left not having the status of the package for WEEKS until I contacted customer support. As you begin adding products to your store, beware that many of them will randomly go out of stock. Management needs a much better process in place to vet these suppliers. This app should absolutely not be anywhere close to $50 a month. UPDATE: *After leaving this review, Spocket reached out to me and requested I do a 3 month free trial to see if my experience changed. I did not use Spocket services during this time and they refused to issue a refund. Says alot about a company willing to sour an experience over $49.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"We Love Spocket!!! Amazing Customer Service and the team really helps you in whatever you would need at any time! Great products and the products even have product descriptions that you can use or modify to assist in getting product to the our store!

5,,"Easy to use this application & the quality of a good product, with fast shipping, I recommend using",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I am on the basic plan, I wish there were more options to be able to use more premium products. Besides that, the app works very well and its nice being able to find products that actually ship from the US.",Spocket,Shopify

1,,"My experience with Spocket was absolutely awful. They have very low inventory, poor technical support, unreliable suppliers, hyper-inflated prices that don't allow you to make a profit, and charge an exorbitant monthly fee to boot. No thank you.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,i used this app to help me add nice products to my website. I hope that this app brings me sales and my clientele increase.,Spocket,Shopify

3,,So far it’s been a good experience using this app! The processes are simple and clear. I also love the products!UPDATE - I have to change my rating because I’m experiencing an issue with one of my first orders. It was placed two weeks ago and is still in processing. The supplier advertised 2 to 3 days processing and 5 to 7 delivery. Customer service has been trying to contact the merchant for almost a week with no success. This is a really bad experience for myself and my customer. I now have to refund my customer with hopes of getting my funds back.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Spocket is easy to use and support respond time is great. A lot of opportunities to improve your experience with Spocket.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Love this app, great products, and I love the fact that they have multiple warehouses which speeds up shipping.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,This app makes drop shipping so much easier than advertised! I particularly love the wide variety of products and sellers. The premium products are worth upgrading your package!,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"This app is not worth it. They have drop shippers selling to drop shippers charging outrageous prices. Their premium prices are even worse. Shopify needs to find suppliers that are true wholesale. Can't make money on this overpriced merchandise. Removed the app today. Updated review: In response to Spocket's response to my review. How would I be able to report any of your suppliers since I deleted your app? You should look into your suppliers on your own, especially your 'premium' suppliers. You are taking advantage of Shopify merchants and you are allowing your suppliers to do the same. I can't find one single app on Shopify that doesn't have drop shippers selling to drop shippers inflating the prices and shipping to outrageous levels. You should all be ashamed. You should be seeking out true WHOLESALERS to sell to and dropship for Shopify merchants. 20-35% discount on actual market prices? Do you mean retail prices? If so, you need to do more research and police your own suppliers because most of them are way above that. I wish I could find a supplier app on Shopify that is honest and isn't charging OVER retail and taking advantage. We all want to make money but all you're doing is driving prices up for everyone. I'm disgusted.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Thx for the great service and fast shipping time. Unlike using AliExpress which has a very Lomb shipping period.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I do not recommend this app or this company at all. After going with their $99 a month plan and importing a large slew of products, I realized that 90% of my products had absolutely outrageous shipping costs (even if they were shipping from the USA), while others were shipping from outside countries with even more ridiculous shipping cost and delivery times ranging from 15-30 days if not longer. After cancelling my membership with Spocket, I immediately lost access to all of my products (which makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is the fact that I cancelled my membership shortly after being charged for it, then lost all of my access without ever receiving a refund - I've since asked Spocket for a refund and am awaiting their response). I only received one order of Spocket products, and this order was COMPLETELY mishandled causing severe issues and frustration with the customer. Not only did it take seven days just to ship the item in the first place, but once it was shipped, it then took another week or so and ended up in Texas when the shipping address for the customer was CLEARLY in Oregon. Now since my account is cancelled, I'm unable to submit order inquiries and try to resolve the situation with my customer. I will not be using Spocket again, ever.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I love this app and it’s easy to use and very affordable for anyone who loves r want to start a store r need money,Spocket,Shopify

5,,I use the app to dropship and it's amazing. I don't have any complaints about this app. I will continue to use it. I have not sold any product so far. I'm still getting the website up and running. The products and the pictures are great. I don't believe that you can't go wrong with using the app.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I love using spocket for my products. I was confused when I did a test purchase on my site. My site was showing pending processing. I forgot that I had to go to Spocket to finalize the order. So far, no problems with Spocket.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Very expensive products, with shipping times that aren't what they show (sometimes more than 30 days). Suppliers are liars and they make you waste time, money and customers. But the worst thing is that you are not protected by this ""company"" even if you pay their most expensive plan, they always win and they never take responsability from the bad service of their suppliers... don't recommend it if u wanna be succesful... try others like eprolo, sourcinbox or cjdropshipping, I've never have problems with them, they have rasonable prices, and don't steal your money making you pay for a suscription to access products that are always out of stock",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Spocket is awesome! App is very easy to use and works great! Quality and shipping rates are good also!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I was introduced to Spocket on a Youtube video I begin researching when I first heard about dropshipping and ever since that day when I visited this site and add a few products to my store I have been using this site until now.

1,,"Do not use this platform. There refund policy is hidden, because you won't get one. Suppliers will not ship products on time. In order to contact them you have to chat with spoket, and wait days for a response. I had an issue with a vendor that took a week longer than advertised to ship. I requested a refund, as my sales channel refunded the customer due to long times. 2 days after said request, Supplier shipped the order. 3 weeks later Supplier requested the product. Yea. Right. A customer gets a free product at my expense. So fk me. Spoket will not refund my annual account. Again fk me. So fk spoket. My bank is processing both returns, and labeling spoket as fraudulent because they do not display there refund policy clearly. At least someone knows how to provide decent service.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,The app is very intuitive to use and the real-life support has been top-notch - live chat and e-mails are answered quickly. I'm just getting started and was using another app that just imported from AliExpress before... I've found this app and their suppliers much more reliable. I'm targeting the Australian market and their product search filters let you find Australian suppliers or suppliers who ship to Australia really easily. The only change I would love to see is being charged in my local currency (AUD) rather than only USD.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,I used this app to help me with my On-line Shopping website!! They have done a great job and helped me out along the way. They have great suggestions and guide you the whole way through.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Fantastic customer support! Very quick to acknowledge any questions/issues regarding the various suppliers.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I like the fact that they have multiple suppliers. I also like that you can pretty much get anything from anywhere that ships from the US.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Awesome app lets you select ship from country! Way better than Oberlo in it's current state. Recommend to anyone,Spocket,Shopify

5,,"So for going off without a hitch, Spocket is currently the main supplier at this moment, Overall good service no complaints as of yet!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Completed my first order using the Spocket Ali Scraper as a Chrome extension. This is a great extension making the transfer of products from AliExpress to your store super easy. Spocket is really easy to use and when delivery timing is tight from overseas, i.e. Chinese New Year closures. Spocket has lots of short delivery products to keep your business running. My only issue is the order of search feature results which returns some relevant products vs. all relevant products requiring me to further scroll through results to find what I need, but compared to manually entering in products, this is a negligent issue esp. if you're an online shopper. Thanks Spocket.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I didn't know what to expect since I was using oberlo at the moment. sprocket is easy to use, lots of products. user-friendly. love it. I recommend it.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I used this app to find suppliers outside China. One thing i did not enjoy though is the international shipping rates.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,I love this! A great way for me to make money for my family right now. Times have been hard the way the world is and this is a huge help.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Very disappointed as new business owner and subscriber to Spocket. My first order was submitted and paid for. Later found out that the supplier deactivated the item. I was advised by Spocket to contact the supplier because my order could still be filled. Was provided confirmation that the order was shipped along with a tracking number. Five days later, checked tracking number and per USPS, the shipment was canceled the same day they told me it was shipped. Additionally, when they marked it as fulfilled (not true) it sent an automatic email to the customer who was under the belief that the item was on its way. My second order was submitted and when I went to pay, I got a message that the supplier is ""not taking orders from December 2020 to March 2021"" and I should notify my customer that there will be a delay. How is this information not given in advance of me loading the items to my store? This is terrible service for my first 2 attempts to utilize Spocket. Will be deleting this app as soon as my first issue is resolved and my money is refunded or item is delivered. It costs too much to have access for what I have been put through in my first 2 weeks with them. Be cautious!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I used this app for my dropshipping business, and it is great. I have access to many products with fast shipping times.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I have just started using spocket and they have great products but they need more suppliers so dropshippers have more products to choose from,Spocket,Shopify

5,,"easy to use.I haven't got any sale. I hope I'll do it. ship will faster than other dropshipping platforms because this is based on the USA. I had tried different platforms. I like this because it easy to transfer the products to my shop. like I said I haven’t got any sale, I am excited for the dreams come true",Spocket,Shopify

They are happy to answer your questions and help you along no matter what time of the day or night. There are a few glitches though, such as not being able to sign out of my account or the option to cancel an account. Although I've asked them how to do these things, they give me instructions and the buttons they say to click just aren't there. Other than that I'm completely satisfied with them and they make it easier to run my store.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,"The app works properly, and love the functionality they offer. The app works properly, and love the functionality they offer.",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"Its a shame that for the app, but i wont be paying for an app that doesn't have the basic search facility of 'EXACT keyword' When i search for a product i want an exact match, not a loose match based on keywords - anyone who has used google knows this. For me to not allow words in "" or ' to exact match in a search is out of date in todays searches. Shame really that a basic facility like this isn't included. My example. Search for orthopaedic cushion and your hit with 1000s of cheap pillows for chairs and i have no way to cut this down to EXACTLY orthopaedic A few of my products would have issues i sell very specific items and sadly i am not going to spend £50 a month (possibly more) on an app where it wont let me specify exacts as it will take longer to find a simple product than just doing it myself ( I currently have 200 products listed on 2 stores and another store with close to 3x that number) Shame honestly if the devs could simple fix this i would be jumping immediately on this app",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Really good app, with quality products! I am starting now but I found really good alternative to other platforms with less quality.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"WARNING - DO NOT USE OR INSTALL THIS APP Out of all the terrible drop shipping apps, this one takes the cake. I have used them for about 4 months and can tell you honestly that this is one of the worst apps on Shopify for the reasons that they don't let you talk to your suppliers. Imagine your customers order being stuck in limbo because you cant even talk to the person who is shipping your order. Not only this, they allow suppliers to have prices that are clearly insane. Imagine trying to sell jewelry at $100's of dollars. Nasa Depot can do so much better than this. DO NOT USE SPOCKET",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is a very good app and the team has been really helpful. This is a very good app and the team has been really helpful.,Spocket,Shopify
3,,Love it but the real test is whether I can make a sale. Not a big fan of the high monthly subscription fee so I question whether it can pay off. Waiting for my Amazon Seller account to be open and hopefully I can get some sales.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,thank you so much spocket.. I'm so happy I can't believe that I'm gonna have my first sale in a couple of mintues,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app is excellent. Help me a lot. I would like to thanks your Spocket Help desk are the best. Thank you.,Spocket,Shopify
3,,So far so good all except I'm struggling with shipping settings. All these app extensions are killing me and takes up so much space.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This app shipping time is very good to gain my customers loyalty. However, up to date inventory would be great so more products can be added.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"This guys wont give a crap about you only about your money. You do not have direct contact with the suppliers on the platform, so if anything goes wrong with an order you have to contact their customer service, which will then reach out to the suppliers and then reach back to you. Good luck with that! I pay them 100 dollars monthly and when an order from spocket failed to deliver to my customer twice ( customer is furious btw) I reached out for help to them and I'm still waiting for an update from spocket's customer service.. DO NOT USE THIS APP! They will not assist you they way they should if something goes wrong with your order. They only know how to collect money from customers and ZERO SUPPORT",Spocket,Shopify
5,,good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I used this app to get control of my shipping and to find more local products. Works really well. Love it.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,super easy to navigate. wide variety of products. now i just need my sales to increase. TIME FOR MORE ADS,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"this was so easy to start, and so easy picking product. I am so impressed with spocket so far, can't wait to add more products from Canada",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This app is very easy to use I am loving it, I only signed up two day ago and I am finding easy to add product to my online store, so hopefully I can make some sales soon.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Small business owners - avoid. Please learn from my face-plant. Spocket is awful. Their shipping destinations changed without notifying me so all of a sudden products didn't ship to Canada. It totally killed any orders in my shop that had a Spocket item in the cart, because the shipping would get messed up, the customer would get frustrated thinking it was my shipping that was the issue, and I'd lose the sale. I had this app for I think 3-4 months? I found zero value with this app, asked for a refund, they said no and sent this message that they are ""sorry the decision did not go in my favour."" Cool, I'm a one-person business, so enjoy my 4 months of subscription dues in exchange for providing literally zero value. In fact, it took a considerable amount of time to even set up the app and find products, list them, fix all the weird tags that the app embedded into the listings, etc., so it's worse than zero, I'm out money AND time, neither of which I have much of. So whatever, I wasn't expecting a refund, just hoping, but if I had received one today, or even I would likely to try it again when you figure out that Canada is its own country and actually make this app useful in Canada. I'm taking the time to write this in hopes of saving just one hopeful soul who adds this to their shop thinking it would be a nice value-add. Is not. Is value-minus. IDK, if you're in the states and you have a big marketing budget, maybe? Don't expect any great shakes in the customer service department.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Finally.....I found a supplier other than AliExpress. One that actually ships from the U.S.A. !!! Beautiful and High-Quality Products. Glad I found them.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I use this app to help me get my first business off the ground. The products are awesome, my customers happy and it leaves me satisfied. Ty",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"Good just fees are high I think, but this is just my opinion. But I think is good, and the manufacturing companies good, the look is good, and many more.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Did not enjoy that when I add to shopify store there isnt a button that comes up directly taking me to that link,Spocket,Shopify
5,,They have a great range of products that ship everywhere. I needed something like this for so long and I'm elated they exist.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Simple to use, great team of 24/7 support, some products are priced on the higher end, but can still make a profit margin in most products. Really liked the way dropshipping works with Spocket.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"In a side-by-side test run that I did with Spocket and another popular dropshipping app, in my opinion, Spocket came out on top due to ease of use, integration with Shopify, shipment labels, packing slips, better and expanded ability of setting pricing rules and generally overall. In Spockets app, I would love to see better listing options like, for example, the ability to list products and corresponding information line-by-line rather than graphically - I would love to see all pertinent information about an item on one or two lines including cost, price, shipping info, etc.I've also noticed a bit of a glitch when searching for products and going to a suppliers page - sometimes it lists the suppliers products along with a variety of products from other suppliers. A simple page refresh usually corrects the problem.Finally, would be nice to see additional shipping options from suppliers, if a supplier offers it, such as regular shipping, express shipping, next day shipping, ups, fedex, etc etc.Bottom line, I love Spocket! I looked at several dropshipping opportunities and, while each had its advantages and disadvantages, for me, Spocket came out on top.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"So many products to add to your store. I totally recommend to use the filter, from where the items are shipped from and/or branded invoice is possible. That gives a better feeling for your customers than just products from somewhere else. Integration works smooth, even if you remove the product there is no extra work needed. Nice to have, price is for beginner level hard to chew",Spocket,Shopify
4,,Just started using the app recently. Just had 2 more orders today and they are so easy to process. Curious to see how fast the shipping is on these 2 items. The first 2 I ordered were a little slow. So far so good though.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I just started and I like the setup, will come back again later on with a more in depth like anddislikes.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,the features so far look phenomenal. I can't wait to scale my business with this app. Im a fresh starting business owner so wish me luck,Spocket,Shopify
2,,"Very nice app and easy to use. However, the product prices can be little lower and I also was charged transaction fees. I am not sure why I am paying this when I have been already been paying for the subscription. Very few products that we can sell and ones that are there are very cheesy. Not worth the subscription fee.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"this app is amazing and very powerful, highly recomend. this app is making my life easier than ever",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Worth the price for SUPER FAST shipping, AMAZING prices that allow for great profits. all around fantastic app! And in first week made my first sales",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app so far is awesome. makes it easy to find premium products. Just wish it could give a category of branded dropship suppliers and non branded ones with just a click of a button. I enjoy the respnse timing,Spocket,Shopify
5,,So far I have picked products and pushed my first product to the store. Very easy to understand and use!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app opens up opportunities. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good...,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"after 10 min i fall in love with this awsome app, fully recomended. Easy to use, intuitive, if you use oberlo then its really easy",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I am beginning to enjoy drop shipping thanks to sprocket yeahhh!! take your time and ask questions be persistent and patient you will be successful,Spocket,Shopify
3,,"I will tell you Spocket is a great app when it wants to be, but there are so many issues with Spocket, it's made want to cancel. First the good... The production selection and pricing is good. You will make money off these items. The selection is great too. Now the bad. When an issue arrives, you need to contact support. I had several of their suppliers send out the cost invoice instead of the price invoice. So when you charge $35 for an item that cost $11, and your customer wants to know why the invoice says $11 when you charged $35, have fun with that conversation. Another situation where Spocket onboarded a supplier and I went to try to purchase the item and the supplier hasn't setup their billing correctly, and now 5 days later, it is still not setup, and they get no response from the supplier, and now my customer is ticked off, and I am told I have to wait. If Spocket onboarded correctly, they should be running a sandbox transaction to make the client is setup correctly. So before you invest in Spocket understand, they have great prices, great selection, and decent customer service, but their proccess management is ineffective.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"SUPER SIMPL and easy , the most important part is the shipping timing IMO and I found some pretty nice actual products that are not widely available in e-bay or amazon and neither Ali",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"So far I'm loving it! I initially tried other apps on Shopify, but after building my website and reading all the reviews on the Internet about Spocket, I'm so much happier...",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The app works fine. It's definitely not traditional dropshipping though as you cannot communicate directly with your suppliers. Spocket is the middle man and they give the suppliers alias names. In addition to that, if you do a test order or if a order is cancelled, it can't be removed from spocket. so you gotta make sure you don't accidentally try to fulfill it. also, the suppliers are actually selling their products to you at retail price. Spocket doesn't have any regulations. Doesn't care. They basically just want to get paid. You will have very minimum contact with Spocket, keep that in mind. This is basically just something you use for starters. As long as you know that, you won't get upset.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Easy to use! Love it! I am very satisfied with this platform! CHeers to spocket community and all the users!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Its very easy and simple to add products to your store and the prices are reasonable, i am satisfied with the platform at this moment.",Spocket,Shopify

1,,"Horrendous customer service. The vendors they use are terrible. Constantly taking items out of availability, or better yet, you have an item listed in your store, and then go through the process of trying to place the order with the vendor and you just can't; you just get an error and no one will help. The time it takes them to even respond to an issue is the mind boggling. If you want to have unhappy customers, use Spocket. They just want your money, and then leave you hanging with constant issues. I should have heeded the warnings of other reviewers. You WILL regret it if you sign up with them.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,I am not computer savvy so I am very happy that Spocket has such wonderful products and pictures of all products.

1,,"customer service is ok, but the huge problem is that the suppliers they have don't stick to the processing time, and the shipping takes too long, for example i had products that were sold and from those suppliers it says processing time 1-2 business days but next thing you know 5 business days passed and the item was not processed, on some items it was more than 5 business days......i had to cancel a couple of items because my customers were waiting too long and i had to offer them refunds to keep them happy, also when i contacted customer service they kept telling me that they were waiting for a reply from the supplier but many of my customers were not happy with the delays did mention i was playing umpire membership prices...not good",Spocket,Shopify

1,,"SHOPIFY SELLERS - THINK TWICE BEFORE USING SPOCKET AS A FUFILLMENT SERVICE I have used Spocket for a little over 2 months now - The best thing about them is that they have an easy to use import feature. EVERYTHING else though? GARBAGE. You have no idea how frustrating it is to have an order placed, and have the need to change something, or the need to communicate with the person who is actually fulfilling your order. These people do not understand the need to communicate with people... They are trying to be a middleman and their business will be dying very shortly because of it. Do you really want to build your business with an app like this? Seriously ask yourself because I can guarantee that they will be out of business soon because of their terrible business practices. The other terrible thing? THEY DON'T UPDATE OR CHANGE ANYTHING ON THE PLATFORM. There is no ability for the users to suggest new features because these idiots are trying to monopolize the drop shipping platform and are failing miserably. I cant believe Shopify continues to let this app be installed as its pretty much Malware. Update: They called and begged me to remove my review and offered me one year free of their premium service. I agreed and after 6 months I can tell you that this app is the worst app in the app store. PLEASE go and try them so you can find out how terrible they are. Then, when you are finished, leave an honest review because all of their reviews are fake as them. Still the worst app on the app store",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Really amazing products!! Good descriptions on products. Good support chat/. Good interface. good fotos.,Spocket,Shopify
3,,"They're okay. They're a bit lost on communication and not always the best help but they are the quickest and easiest way to not only add items to my inventory but push them to my store as well. The communication needs a lot of help starting with having to pay for chat support,",Spocket,Shopify

5,,"I am still new to using this app but so hard the process has been pretty seamless. I will update if there are any changes but it has been the least confusing for me to use compared to others.

3,,Not the best for dropshipping clothing. I worked with a Spocket supplier who ended up having low quality products and using product images that didn't match what my customers actually received.

One suggestion though, on the import list, in the Sales Price section, it would be nice to enter an amount value in addition to the percentage value, so we could just type the amount in standard dollars & cents format when setting profit margins.

5,,I love the products!  A little pricey for the rookie that I am.  Looking forward to my first sale!:),Spocket,Shopify
1,,"As a paid subscription, I wouldn't recommend this to new sellers. Wait until you find that you can support an audience. Also, do your research and make sure that they have enough products for you. Their selection is very minimal. The main reason for the one star is because I tried to cancel one day past free trial because I don't find it very useful but they refused. 100% not a business practice from a company that I would want to do business with. You have to be a pretty big scumbag to hold someone's money and not provide a service. Good luck with the chargeback!",Spocket,Shopify

The fact that most products ship from the US makes shipping be much faster so that can even help with profit margins and trust with your customers. I am already seeing sales with their great suppliers and the awesome pictures that are included with the product. Also the way that it's integrated with shopfiy makes it really easy for my customer to make the order, and when I go in the app they already have the customer's info and what they ordered ready for me to just click ""check out"" , and once the order is paid for it's shipped, and the shipping information is automatically sent to the customer! I mean they could't have made this any easier. The only thing I would recommend is....more products! Other than that I found a niche that I love through them and is loving the options that I have available to me so far. I deal with no other dropshipping provider but them. Thanks Spocket!",Spocket,Shopify

1,,"Unbelievably bad. I was charged AGAIN for October. Stay far away from this scammy app. *Update: well, John was helpful and I got a refund after phone calls and emails. But it shouldn't have been that hard - and of course I shouldn't have been charged in the first place. Apparently there is a lot of confusion around the ""free trial"" and this happens a lot, so why doesn't this company change that?? Probably because it works for them - I only noticed because I checked my credit card statement. I'm sure there are plenty out there who don't and this company just pockets the money. Add to this the fact the ""financial team"" sent me a generic email saying they reserve the right to adhere to their no refund policy... So I am thankful to John, but this company needs a serious shake up. I don't recommend it at all. Crap. I deleted it after one day and have just been charged nearly $50, how? Terrible business, stay away. There are much better apps out there",Spocket,Shopify

5,,Great suppliers with quality products accompanied by great customer service! What more could you ask for,Spocket,Shopify
2,,I have three orders and all seems well so far. I am not sure about many of the products because there is no way to see any reviews for any products or suppliers. The fact that you can't communicate with suppliers is a huge drawback and I hope that changes. Also being able to review products so others can read it would be really helpful. Those changes would make Spocket a five star app and I'll give five stars when I see those improvements.,Spocket,Shopify

You would expect even the starter package would give you access to support, after all, more than 30% of clients choose to invest instantly after chatting live with a support agent, who helps them decide if your service is really what they need. Spocket limits chat support to pro and empire users which is why we had to give this a one star. The supplier discloses a 3-5 days processing time and the order fails to even be updated to ""delayed"" after this time limit expires. Mind you the order still remains as paid with no information on when this is expected to be fulfilled to this day.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,"Fantastic dropshipping company. Super fast, awesome quality products, and great customer service. Easy to use",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"The pros are easy product search and a decent variety of EU/USA suppliers. This saves the time of sourcing suppliers. And some of the suppliers are conscientous with really great descriptions and size charts; others are a little bare bones in the descriptions and your creativity is needed - which is fine. I would like it if  the cost of purchase would populate into shopify rather than manual add. Or additionally, being able to download a spreadsheet of your inventory with each vendor to cross reference prcing etc... Some of the products are ideal for global shipping and have a relatively decent margin, others do not. Global shipping can be limited with certain suppliers, or the shipping costs are so different between continental USA and the rest of the world, that you must be prepared to manage that difference in your shipping settings.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,Great experience and user-friendly! You should try it too and Im sure you will love it. They also offer free trial.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,The best aliexpress competitor so far. Have a lot of products but still not many tech products are available. Customer support is super fast and super helpful. It has extremely easy user interface. I would give 5 star if it had gaming and some high ticket products.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Very good app with lots of potential if used correctly , yet to see if the while process works as well as it seem, however its all very promising indeed.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Still trying to figure it out but seems very interesting. But I can already see there's lots of help and tools to assist.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Customer support is practically non-existent. It is a decent system unless you have ANY issues (which you always will with dropshipping). Unless you have an upgraded plan, the only way to reach support is through email which they do not respond promptly to. Very disappointed.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I love the fact that I do not have to struggle to look for prices.  I also like the shipping time. I ordered a product and it came on time as promised,Spocket,Shopify
1,,There's nothing worth promoting.  Low Inventory. I'm not spending Ad money promoting a product with 5-7 in stock. Only cheap POD products have high inventory. My personal observation for over 3 months. It ain't getting any better. Other items are way too pricey. I'd be doing them a huge favor getting'em off their hands.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Love Spocket! Very convenient and fast fulfillment, great choice of suppliers and products! Thank you",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I didn't know it was this easy! I littereally picked a product edited the description and listed it!,Spocket,Shopify

5,,"Some limitations with respect to webdesign, but template have all the basis needed to get to market, although we didn't expect to have to pay for add-on apps, some which are necessary for regulatory adherence. Overall, a great way to quickly and simply launch a E-comm business.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Acces to millions of items all over the world. its incredible. Im a starter on dropshipping and so far im learning my way around. The only thing is the high prices on shipping, makes it a tad bit harder to make myself profit and give a fair price to my customers.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Im new to the dropshipping world, I love Spocket very user friendly and great products to choose from.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,I am new to Spocket and so far their customer service has been excellent and Spocket is so easy to use with Shopify!,Spocket,Shopify
4,,Very user-friendly! I was able to add my new product fairly easy. The Aliscraper tool helped steamline the process as well.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Have been using Spocket for about a year and it's been nice to see it grow, change, and develop! From the beginning, it was easy to use and figure out, and the support staff is extremely responsive if you run into any issues. Would recommend this service over any other dropshipping aggregate that I've tried!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Love it, Made it super easy and affordable to start my online store. shopify gives you all the tools needed even coaching to succeed.

5,,"we used the Spocket app and it helps us a lot. the products are good, it's helping us to manage the products.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is better than all the other apps for your store! It is also way better than shipping with Ali Express. It costs money but is worth it for your store.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,i enjoyed how easy it is to access different products and change and review the names prices and information on the products that i am selling.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,I really did not have any good experience. At first i was thinking keeping my store full with US or European product will be more reliable and quality but sorry to write here that what products i found here was no really worth . in addition there is monthly charges to use their services as well which is too high for startup people like me .  Overall bad experience when i need support as their support link never worked.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I  hope the 5 stars will hold up and I will just love spocket I just started so I don't know yet. If what I have heard is true I should love it that is why the good rating.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,First time drop shipper and Spocket has been fantastic to work with!  I can't wait to see where I go and develop along with Spocket!,Spocket,Shopify
2,,"I'm updating this again. I have mixed feelings on this app. I have had SO MANY problems with orders, but I will say that the issues were caused by the supplier and not Spocket themselves. As a result, I will share my thoughts on them separately.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I used this app to help me Improve my store. I really like how it does. It would be nice if it did better.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I use this app to help me build my store an the clothes is beautiful for women & kids and men thank you !,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I used this app to locate domestic drop shipping items, and items with free shipping. I love how quickly I could navigate the site, and push items to store. I wish there was a way to mark items of interest instead of adding them to the import list.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I love the app! Easy to use with a great variety of products. I am an online store for men's and boys' clothing and accessories. Here are my recommendations: (1) include more business casual and business formal clothing items for men; and (2) improve the search functions. There are limited business casual and business formal clothing items, such as blazers, dress shirts, and dress shoes for men. If this is not the case, please improve the search function. When a person searches for or toggles through categories by men's clothing, many women's items come up on the results.",Spocket,Shopify

4,,"I used this to add and drop ship products that were made in the U.S. The Shipping Times were good, but I didn't get to test the products out so I don't know the quality of the products.

1,,"DO NOT USE SPOCKET. I've cancelled for two months now, received confirmation from TWO of their support team members on separate occassions saying my cancellation was confirmed and for both months I've been charged the monthly fee! The first month I got refunded and had them confirm with IT to ensure the cancellation went through, they said it did. Yet I was charged again. Ridiculous. Generic items and suppliers lie about where they're shipping from. DON'T USE SPOCKET!!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,At first I was skeptical that they would be able to deliver on value but their entire team has exceeded my expectations. Very. Good. App. Period.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I am beginning to love this app. I am looking forward to a great transformation and customers satisfaction.,Spocket,Shopify

1,,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE customer service. I deleted the app, the found out spocket charged me, and reached to their customer service about refunding just one day after the first charge. Not only they don't want to refund me, and they also restarted my plan after I downgraded and told me I will be charged again in the next bill cycle.  And after downgrading, I lost all the privilege. I was charged for $49 for one day of ""unused"" service. They are fast at taking your money. Sure now they updated their policy to say uninstalling doesn't cancel the plan, but they never mentioned this during installation. They want you to install it, and forget about it and just charge you in secret. SCAM.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,Wish the try Pro for free option worked... I would have used it. I’ll go with what I’ve got now. Maybe upgrade later.,Spocket,Shopify

I have people emailing me everyday about orders. STAY AWAY. I repeat DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. The customer service DOES NOT REPLY. Imagine more than half your orders not being shipped? I am seeking legal help. They basically STOLE MY MONEY and do not reply. Their suppliers ARE NOT FROM THE USA. They are all from CHINA.  This app is a SCAM. DO NOT USE. DO NOT USE. STAY AWAY.

5,,Spocket has made it very easy to add items to my store. I had to upgrade my basic free trial to the next level because 25 items with only 1 premium didn't feel like enough of a variety to offer customers. I hope I can make enough sales and recoup the monthly fees.,Spocket,Shopify

4,,"it is a great app. really easy to use and easy to move items to your personal store. wish the pro plan could have more premium items though.  besides that for someone who just started to have their own online shop, spocket  is my go to app.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,Great app.  Good selection of products and easy to edit descriptions and products information.  Super easy to push products to my store.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I think there are a lot of changes that could be made to make things easier for the stores. Especially for dropshipping. For example, I receive notices of prices changes for items or shipping rate changes for stores but I'm not told the specifics so I do not now how much the item increased or decreased in price or what the new shipping rate will be for the store. I would also like to see a way to 'file' items you do not want to push to your store immediately. For example, in summer I would like to file way a winter outfit to publish when the seasons change.  Great customer service, very timely responses but it could be more user friendly - especially for the price you pay each month.",Spocket,Shopify

4,,"Products seem to be of high quality, and the support team (John), is very quick to get back to you if you have any issues.

5,,Great products. I wish there was a way to automate costs and markup! Searching for products using multiple filters would be awesome too.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,thank you for giving me the opportunity to make good money using shopify and spocket to get starter,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I wanted an app that would help me dropship US sourced products for faster shipping for my customers.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,Мне очень нравится это приложение. Хотя я только что начала с ним работать и возможно еще не знаю всех нюансов.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Best droppers I’ve ever tried. Awesome products. Typically fast shipping unless supplier has a long processing time. Which in that case you see in the product page. I just had one order take the full 10 day for shipping tracking to become available. But most are delivered in 3-5 days.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,Be careful!!!!!! I ordered sample products from the list of USA suppliers on May 10. It took almost a month for the samples to arrive. I called customer service requesting an update on the status of my order. Customer service did not reply right away with the status.  When they responded they told me my package was coming from China. Mind you All of the suppliers I ordered from were to be USA base because I did not want the shipping time for my customers to be long. When the order arrived on June 6 it was not what I order and did not look like the picture. I wish I could upload the pictures of what was sent to me. The merchandise was poorly made and looks like something you would give a child to play dress up. So I say again BE CAREFUL!!! and make sure you order samples before selling to your customers.,Spocket,Shopify

1,,"So, my third and final edit of this review, It isn't worth it, especially for their prices. They only 2 orders that I made had problems, 1 one of them took a long time to arrive and when it arrived it broke while being opened and the other item had delays because for some reason the seller put the wrong zip code even though I gave them the correct address. I tried to contact their support chat but it never works when you need it. Also, some of the items were constantly becoming unavailable or changing to premium status in order for you to upgrade your plan so you could sell them. And last but not least, I was getting daily emails from them giving me the ""reasons"" for me to upgrade my plan, like jeez at least do weekly emails instead of sending me their advertisements every day",Spocket,Shopify

1,,"The WORST customer service ever seen! A customer placed and order 3 weeks ago, I had to ask them at least 10 times why wasnt the order shipped. After a long back and forth. They cancelled the order because they just realized that the supplier cannot ship to my customers country (the country is not on the list of countries that the supplier can not ship). So it took them 3 weeks to check the status of my order.",Spocket,Shopify

3,,"I’ve been using this app for about 3 months. The only reason why i didn’t give it 1 star is because of the customer service from spocket. It’s great. BUT... the suppliers Do not care about your business. Careless mistakes, sending the wrong product, send one item when the customer ordered 2. The shipping times DO NOT.. i repeat DO NOT match what spocket writes on the product descriptions. Some items ship quick, some take months. Long story short... I know that in order for me to grow my brand I’m going to need to find new suppliers.",Spocket,Shopify

1,,"I am a bit worried here about their customer support.  My first order with them  is not going well.  Customer bought 3 items - 1 of the items  had a Covid-19 delay in shipping warning (Made in China?) - this item says Made in the USA.  It had a 7-10 day processing time.  The other two items have a 1-2 day processing time.  My customer received tracking information within 2 days.  A week later, US Postal is still waiting for the package.  Customer not happy, I had to send him some of our own products to try and make him happy.  E-mailed support, Andie told me that the products were still in the 7-10 day processing window.  That's when I looked it up and found 2 of the products were 1-2 days.  I sent Andie a message about this, and got no reply.  Followed up again with Andie this morning and no response.  Just a head's up, all of their happy and positive e-mails come from support@spocket - not from individual people. Here I am left with a situation from my first Spocket customer and no one can help.  This business is fast paced, people need to get their orders quickly.  Can you imagine getting a tracking number and finding out that many days later that the items haven't been sent out yet?  I really wanted to sell my products on Spocket and I'm sure I ruined that opportunity now.  We send our products out next day.  If it's out of stock, we don't sell it.  I hope someone at Spocket will now help me figure this out.......",Spocket,Shopify

1,,"I have 2 major complaints. (1) Customer service can't do anything to actually help or give any real answers to any questions, other than some generic form response. I emailed about a very specific issue I was having that should have been simple to address but instead of an answer, I was told ""we can give you free service for 3 months"". That's nice, and I appreciate it, but I would like my issue resolved. (2) There is no way for the store owner to contact the suppliers, no way to know how reliable the suppliers are, no way to know the quality of their products, and no way to know if they plan on continually supplying products or if they're only in business to empty out inventory. I have spent MONTHS building my store, painstakingly editing poorly written descriptions, ordering samples of products with high inventory, updating photographs, filming videos, etc., only to have products and suppliers disappearing left and right. All of my hard work, time, and money is being wasted because it is impossible to communicate with suppliers. There needs to be a line of communication between the store owner and the supplier so a relationship can be formed. Store owners need to be able to write reviews on suppliers and their products to keep them honest. Currently there is only a star rating based on supplier shipping times and no way for store owners to provide their own rating on suppliers or products. I spent weeks, not to mention hundreds of dollars, building advertising campaigns around products I purchased, filmed videos for, and photographed that have vanished with no explanation or warning. This is not okay! My store isn't live yet, but what will happen when I am live and the products I am advertising to draw in customers don't exist on my store? I'm the one who ends up looking bad. Please, fix this major gap and hold suppliers accountable for their business practices and allow store owners to form relationships with them. Please explain to these suppliers that they cannot charge retail prices to wholesalers. And please give customer service real information so they can actually help people.",Spocket,Shopify

1,,"I tried it. The first thing I did was to test order from 3 suppliers who claimed to have U.S. to U.S. shipping.  That is the #1 reason I wanted to PAY for this app.  Well, the U.S. to U.S. shipping claims are complete B.S.  Takes forever for shipping. Still have not received ANY of my orders.  So, they may be ""shipping from the U.S."" but that would only be after they order your product from China.

1,,"After 2 months using this app and dealing with them I can only advise people to go away. This is what I believe gives Legal Scam a definition. After nearly 200 sales and over $8000 turnover, we had NO profit. The costs of this app are ridiculously high and the gross profit margins are very little (20-25%).Out of all this sales we had only 2 issues and they are taking so much time to refund us. It's dodgy, very dodgy. They stop responding when we showed them proofs that we were right. So we had to refund the costumer and received nothing yet.If you are looking into dropship, just Google for your niche and you will find direct suppliers, no good to have a middle-man, specially when are this guys.",Spocket,Shopify

I had 2 customers placing order with a supplier where the warehouse located in USA have the processing time 2-3 days, and delivery 4-7 days. It has been a week and the order is still “processing”. 3rd. Suddenly they tell me that the products are out of stock and the supplier change the processing time to 7-10 days. 4th. My 2 first order status, which was placed on 4/4/2020 and today is 04/12, before going out of stocked, never change the status, still “processing”.5th. My customers are upset and requested me a refund with very frustrating emails. I have spoken to the customer service at Spocket and they kept telling they won’t give me a refund or cancel the order due to the high demand on the product right now. note that the order is still “processing”, which means they should refund and cancel since it hasn’t been shipped yet.6th. I am very disappointed at the Spocket app and team. They didn’t care about my business being jeopardized due their priorities and disorganization. I will never use this app again.",Spocket,Shopify

Very limited when it comes to contacting the provider, they don't allow you to contact the provider directly and they try to pass any questions you might have through them, 3 weeks have passed and I am still waiting on the response regarding a product. PLEASE be wary that even though the app might say that some items are shipped from the U.S. it will not always be the case because when you actually look at the tracking number the products are being shipped from China.",Spocket,Shopify

I wanted to test to start selling products and ship from USA, I placed 10 orders to test, 4 orders were cancelled and 2 orders still not shipping after 2 months and 1 order not even refunded to my card. I let them this money and run away because I lost my time and energy. Just stop this guys and give people their money back. And for people that want to use this please don't try not recommended at all.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"This app is absolutely terrible to use, you cannot filter anything and there is just junk everywhere at inflated prices. SCAM! SCAM! The items are not unique, the brands are selling themselves through their own websites, amazon and even etsy stores and are all easily found Google. This is insane all those reviews and case studys; and not even 1 single product can be sold uniquely as you verily claim on those case study's. Also there is a massive problem with your filters; you do not give enough options to select a small group of products or just products that only have 4-7 days shipping. In my opinion to make such false claims and then charge such amounts can only mean one thing; its just a SCAM!",Spocket,Shopify

5,,"I started using Spocket recently. The order process works really well and requires little effort.  You have to research your products and niche properly since not everything has a high enough margin  to profit well.  I found some really great items with high profit margins, and ones that dont sell on Aliexpress. I think the bad reviews are more around the suppliers.  Even though Spocket approves vendors, you should make sure your vendor is good.  Do a test order first.  Spocket provides the platform, but they arent the ones actually shipping.  Thought I would mention that since i tend to read all of the 1 star comments before evaluating anything.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,I really enjoy using Spocket because it is easy to use. Searching and importing items are really easy.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I like how easy Spocket is to use, but it would be absolutely 5 stars if I was able to alter the description/tags/etc from the 'My Products' tab after it was pushed to my store. However, that is just a minor flaw in an otherwise really good addition to any store.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I was most pleased with the product descriptions included with the products. They usually include bullet points, bold texts and extensive details. I haven't seen that in any other drop-shipping apps yet. Saves time and insures better search engine optimization.",Spocket,Shopify

1,,"I have a business physically, with more than 500 products in 3 physical stores. I decided to put this App to add some products that I do not have, for online sales. I found myself with unqualified suppliers, very high shipping prices, the first trial order was canceled after 12 days of waiting. It was for me, I wanted to test the system before taking my clients. The customer service is incompetent, they never knew what happened to my shipment. they just told me wait until this day. Another one of the customer service seems racist. He does not know what Puerto Rico, Hawaii or Virgin Islands is part of the USA, and I treat in a contemptuous and minimizing way. or mentioning Mexico ?. I really never thought of meeting these types of people giving support services.",Spocket,Shopify

I wanted to test it before diving in so I pushed 24 products to my store front - had 11 orders from them including 3 samples I ordered to see product and shipping times. I have been battling with them for a while as all these items state anywhere from 4 -10 days delivery. I will share the orders and their status below. Yesterday I had it, I told them how I felt and that they needed to get better suppliers or a better system (you can not contact the supplier, you have to have it all go through spocket and wait for an answer) They read my messages yesterday and STILL have not replied to me! I am fuming - I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP!!!!!",Spocket,Shopify

5,,Just starting using this app. Looking good so far. Love being able to brand and having faster shipping times.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,So far so good.  The shipping times have made us make the move to this app. The apps we have used in the past have been a little slow and poor quaily.  We find that Spocket is much better with the added ability to brand your invoice that goes to the customer.,Spocket,Shopify

4,,The app is clean and does what it says. Probably could use a few more hot products but all in all I would recommend it for beginners.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"My niche is difficult to find products for in many dropshipping sites, but Spocket has done a great job really diversifying the kinds of products they offer and having something for every niche. The only reason I don't have five stars is that I want to be able to contact the vendors, even if it is not directly, but if there is an issue with a product there is no communication, only a refund. Overall very user-friendly site and great products!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The app is fantastic. Compared to Oberlo, it is much user friendly and shows you step by step how to add products to the store.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,Trying for first time.  Seems very easy to use.  Nice product choice. Looking forward to a prosperous endeavor.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I really like the app because of the quick delivery to US and EU. The inventory is not as wide as on the Asian, but still plenty of products to choose from.Probably the few things that I don`t like, is the lack of reviews for products and very poor size information for clothing and footwear. But overall, it`s great",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"Good quality, fast shipping in Canada, I'm very satisfied of the service. I find the suscription price a bit expensive, but overall it's good!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,i used this app to find best products with best delivery time.. so far I like what I see. and I wish I could see statistic of sales and orders of products,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"You definitely have to order samples to make sure your working with a good supplier (because there are some duds), but overall Spocket has the best collection of suppliers for anyone looking to dropship QUALITY products to the US without having ridiculous shipping times or prices.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,love love love. Kim on the support team rocks! Can't wait to keep using spocket and selling online!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Really enjoy that the products are made in the US!! I personally like this app much more than Oberlo!,Spocket,Shopify

5,,"Using this app for my new store and it's super simple, even for a newbie with little tech experience like myself!",Spocket,Shopify

5,,"So easy to use. Just install, choose products and they do the rest.Would recommend this app to anyone",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I used the app to help me find products to populate my store. It was easy to navigate, read and edit the products details, add it to my import list, and then push to my store. I was advised to use this app by a very successful Spocket user and I'm glad I did.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This app has high quality products (many made and shipped from the USA) and outstanding customer service. I recently attempted to transfer my Unicorn Spocket membership from one Shopify shop to a second Shopify store/account that I own, and the customer service and tech departments not only made it possible, but made it a totally seamless process. Erwin and Charelean (aka Cha) made a technically complex transition go off without a hitch, and they were friendly and communicative every step of the way. I'm excited to get this new shop going, and know that I can always reach out if I have issues. It's not easy figuring all this out from scratch, truly. And it'd be damn near impossible without good people on the other side helping to usher my unique goals forward.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"What lack of professionalism they have, I placed an order from January 24 and to date I have not received my product, I talked to them several times and I thought they were going to solve the problem, but it was all a lie, a request that I made should take 4-7 days, I hope they learn and take some professionalism because I see that they do not have it.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Love it! Makes it easy to use quality American products! Not like those bad boy chinese products i dont like them!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Spocket has helped me to realize the potential of my Shopify store! They offer great products and local suppliers that offer quick shipping times. I definitely feel as if this is a good investment into my business.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,So far so good. I'm a Newbie at all this online store stuff and the decision process of picking Spocket over a couple other options was a little daunting. I knew coming in though that I wanted only US suppliers.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Very smooth interface, user-friendly, and great products! Great to see high-quality products coming out of the U.S.A",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This App is everything I was looking for. I do use another dropshipper but Spocket has a better selection, faster site, and allows me to really find what I wanted in the products I sold. It's incredibly user friendly has an interface more companies should adopt. I look forward to working with them.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app is AMAZING. They made the process of starting my own Shopify dropshipping store so simple and easy.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This has been an amazing help! Before I struggled to find suppliers but Spocket makes it so easy with even better shipping times!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I was thinking this would be like the china drop-shippers but it isn't. There are a a lot of product choices and it is very easy to use.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I used another app in a previous drop-shipping business and had a terrible experience. I am part of a Facebook page for drop-shipping and this app was highly recommended. This app has been extremely easy to use and I have got my new business up and running with ease!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Spocket is a great app! I am using it to find awesome products to sell. It is so easy with Spocket. I recommend it.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,I love using this App. The products are great. The samples orders came on time. I think it will help me grow my business,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I have used the Starter Package with this app.  The products are what I am looking for, and the search interface is fast and intuitive.  The one sample I ordered arrived exactly when promised, which was very important to me.  It is easy to edit the product information and push to my store.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Very professional and good selection of products.  I enjoy browsing and find the best products for dropshipping,Spocket,Shopify

5,,I really like the idea of quick shipping time for EU and US. As they are my main target audience. I hope that the premium product will help me sell more.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,I highly DO NOT recommend these guys. After going to the highest plan. I had some customers order. I then tried to pay spocket but my card kept declining. They kept me in limbo finally figured out the reason and it was there system. They would not give me any other options at all to pay so customer would receive the item. At the end I got a bad review from the customer. They cared nothing about it. Hope you don’t have the same result. But you have been WARNED! Hv a great day!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I used Spocket to help me dropship high quality products made in North America. It is easy to use, the pictures and descriptions are very nice and the shipping time is quite fast. It's worth the price!",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"The prices of most of the items are a bit high, and after the suppliers make a good profit, the merchant's profit margin is already very small. Spocket should do something to get suppliers to give merchants more margin.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I like the fast customer help via Live Chat, always helpful and friendly. I find the online tutorials a bit so-so, having live Chat with Spocket helps a lot, recommended.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,Do not fall for the promotional plan ever with these people.  They charge you instantly and the premium products for most of the suppliers have no description.  And they sent me an email stating that the supplier is pretty new hence no description.  How can you entertain a new supplier to be on your premium list.  Absolutely not recommended.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,The bad reviews are true.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I was seeking a reputable drop-ship company for my small business and found Spocket.  They have more than exceeded my expectations.  I find their interface easy to use and their products are very competitively priced.  I am so thankful that I found them!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Very user friendly... up & running in minutes!  Customer service is top notch... and joining the FB group has been great, too!  My only request is to provide better size charts for your apparel listings and provide the measurements in 'inches' and not only 'cm'.  The majority of items I have to convert for my US based customers & that is time consuming.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I'm new to e-commerce, having just opened my new store, and Spocket's customer service has been very responsive and helpful in answering my questions. I can easily find suppliers that ship from the U.S. (which is very important to me), and a good variety of products. Like every business, I'm sure there are some improvements they could make (which I haven't come across yet!), but they fit my needs for both products and service better than any other company so far.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Im a newbie for e commerce business. one of the best aps i use so far. keep it up and hope near future new and better ideas to come,Spocket,Shopify
5,,They are very unique in their items. The support as well is very helpful and are very attentive to your success.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I'm very excited to use Spocket! I will be using it to sell my products and to import product to my site to expand my selection and assortment for customers. Installing Spocket and getting up and running was so easy!,Spocket,Shopify

5,,Loving this site! They have been a big help to me setting up my store and refreshing my products to sell.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Just starting out and very easy to follow. Everything is very self explanatory and price is reasonable.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"STAY AWAYMy nightmare with Spocket began 6 months ago. I liked the idea to have a subscription with spocket because It was a good option to add more products to my existing online store, that has been in the market for many years with a policy of same day shipping and great reputation, until spocket showed up. What a nightmare.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Perdón por escribir la reseña en español. Realmente estoy muy conforme con Spocket. Tal vez vendría bien un poco más de variedad en indumentaria masculina para enviar a diferentes parte del mundo, ya que gran parte sólo realiza envíos a Estados Unidos. Más allá de eso, muy conforme. Saludos desde Argentina",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Love it, everything is straight forward. Great that items are shipped from within the U.S and EU. And the invoices look professional",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Irene and the team form Spocket have been wonderful to work with. They respond in a very timely manner and answer all of our questions and also help get whatever we needed done. we are looking forward to the continuation of the relationship that has been created into the future.We highly recommend the Spocket team for they are great to work with and know what they are doing.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"So far my experience with this app has been amazing. Excellent customer service and lots of great products. I do wish that there were more European suppliers as it can be challenging to find good products with reasonable shipping rates to Europe. That is my only criticism, and I imagine that there will be more European options as they continue to grow. Overall, highly recommended!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I subscribed to their monthly pro plan. My store hasn't gone live yet and I almost wanted to cancel. I emailed in the morning, there wasn't any response. I chat in the evening and Erwin was able to help me with my concern. Quick response, quick action.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I've had a bit of orders that got me concerned at the beginning but I am really impressed by their customer service and the way they handle things because they are always there to help and everything is always resolved. It just really takes a bit of understanding about how the entire process works. Really good job to this app! I might delete my other apps over so I can upgrade my account here to the highest plan available. :)) Hopefully soon!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I so love this App!! The quality of the products is breathtaking. Absolutely delighted to use this app.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Need more unique product for starter plan thanks, excellent organization of the products and wholesales.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Do not give this company your information! I have been trying to get a problem resolved for 3 months now to no avail! They have double and triple charged me each month and refused to refund for all the overages. Currently I have been charged 8 times, should have been 3. They have refunded me for 2 of the 5 over charges so there’s that. I have asked for a phone number to speak to an actual person but of course they won’t. So 100 emails later and nothing has been resolved! Steer clear of these people!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Love it. It makes such a big difference when the products you dropsell are high quality not like aliexpress.  Highly recommended,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Its been a great experience so far with Spocket and their team. Always so responsive and helpful. Thank you for the support always. Hope to continue like this all the time.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Fellow Entrepreneurs Beware - I don’t like leaving bad reviews but I am leaving one with this app because of a bad experience I had with them that lasted over a couple of weeks. After checking out the app and the merchandise- I paid $49 for one month subscription. I liked the idea of selling products with shorter shipping times. But for some reason, the app would not push the products onto my Shopify shop. I contacted their support team and I was first told to change browsers, then try to see if I was having the same problem on my cell phone. After doing all of that, the app still would not push products to my store.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I'm so loving Spocket, so easy, so many products and helpful support team. This app is definitely recommendable.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is actually a pretty good App...You get a wide variety of USA based suppliers as well as foreign ones as well. They handle custom branded invoices for paid members and yeah its one of the few good dropshipping apps on Shopify that I've come across thus far.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Loving this app so far. Great help with their 24/7 customer service, this app is really awesome to have. I'm sure this would help me get more sales on my store",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I used this app to find products in the UK and hit a few issues along the way but for every hurdle, the Spocket team were there to help resolve every issue, highly recommend for any Shopify account.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"So far so good! Also, love the chat app, someone is always there to answer my questions.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,still testing.so far so goodKinda wondering if it is going to be better than Oberlo. i wish spocket would put the products with the country of origin reference,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Update: The customer service is amazing!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The app is still developing, but what makes the app great is the customer service. They will always try to help you with everything. Great team!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The Spocket team is awesome!   My store isn't up & I've just started using the app, so I'm not sure how the products/suppliers are yet.   Any question or concern I've had is addressed within minutes mostly by live chat.  Sometimes via email.   Great people!",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I did not like their services, they have premium products, which most of the nicer products are premium products and with a paid account at the almost $50 a month mark, you only get to add 25 premium products. You have to pay almost $100 a month just to add premium products. Also, shipping is slow. I placed a test order to see how shipping would be, they still haven't shipped the items out and the order was placed 3 days ago. It is always best to test your suppliers prior to customers placing orders so that way you can work out the kinks. Not happy, so I decided to cancel. You can't just cancel your account, you have to talk to someone and hope they cancel your account. I ended up having to cancel my debit card instead to keep them from being able to charge me. I do not reccommend, try Modalyst instead. They ship faster and are more reasonably priced.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Spocket offers amazing possibilities, and very helpful crew! Looking forward to use it every day! Love it!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Spocket is spot on!  No auto-bot  generic support via chat! Quick, quality responses to questions about processing and shipping times for drop ship product in the US. I wasted time clicking around on other competitor websites. I'm new at this, so having a real person respond was very reassuring. The rep even helped me find products that I was looking for by sending me direct links. My only regret is that I didn't start with Spocket first!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The customer support is spot on for Spocket, and the product selection is actually so awesome now compared to their early beginnings. I can't wait to get started!",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I started an online Department Store and any small business owner or start-up knows how much time and effort it takes. One of the last things I wanted to do was start writing my own product descriptions (it takes a lot of time), and finding quality products to list can seem overwhelming. While Spocket does have products with minimal descriptions (some people prefer it), they also value your time and know you can use all the help you can get. They've created personalized collections for me that are tailored to my page and style. The customer service and assistance alone is worth any subscription cost. I'm glad I decided to stick with Spocket and see what they have to offer. I don't think you'll be disappointed either.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The application is very easy to use - upon signing up, I was able to navigate the platform with ease and start adding products to my Shopify store. I also enjoyed the variety and quality of the products that the application provides retailers.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Love the app. US Products are nice to add to your store. US Products are nice to add to your store.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Spocket is amazing, has a large catalog and very easy to use.  If you find your perfect niche, it's the perfect tool to succeed! highly recommended!",Spocket,Shopify
2,,I've not started using yet as the prices plus shipping seems too expensive to make a decent profit...,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app is easy to navigate and you can find a lot of great products. It has unique product descriptions and beautiful pictures taken too.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,So far so good!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,They have helped me and supported me until now. I love their customer service and how easy they are to use.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"i used this app and its help me alot with my store , its so easy to use this ! i love it i love it it",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"It is great. It has helped me so much so far, I am hopeful that it is going to get me some actual sales. So fingers crossed.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,This Company LIES,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I found the products and the chat tool to be what you might expect.  Unfortunately, I ran a test order to see what a customer might receive and the item sat for over 12 days with no more information than a label had been created.  Via chat I worked with the Spocket team to finally receive the item and when I opened the package, I was nearly in tears.  The item was not as described or pictured, the product was poorly constructed and now I am having a hard time trying to find how you can make a return.  Not feeling warm and fuzzy over this whole experience.  If this item was for a customer, they would surely NOT BUY from me again.  I am considering to cancel the Spocket app and ask for a refund because my customers are looking for excellent products and communication / tracking on items when they are ordered.  I am not confident at this point that I can trust Spocket with my customer orders.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,Only had a brief look while using the free trial. The catalog is not very extensive and some of the products look much worse than the Chinese counter parts. I was mainly looking for 'made in USA' products but there not that many. Even when you find something different that stands out and its in 'made in USA' category it clearly states that outside of USA will ship from China. If you want to open a fashion/clothing shop it could be useful as you can advertise very quick delivery compared to China and the clothing categories seemed to have more products.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Only had the app for a few weeks, but everything has been great. Have made some sales from Spocket and the wide range of products they have to offer. Only thing I wish is that when importing over it would have some verbiage to help you in the description.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I love the easy usability of this app and the selection. Prices are a tad higher, but it is worth it for the quality. Would like more shoe options!",Spocket,Shopify
1,,Products do not include shipping weights.  Shipping costs are not pushed to customer..Bulk editing is not available.  disappointed thus far. that I now have to edit 2100+ product individually and guess shipping weights so that my business doesn't lose money,Spocket,Shopify
5,,very easy to configure and importation is very user friendly. I would recommend this app rather than most common,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I use the app for my beauty and cosmetics dropshipping business.  Love the quality brands and products they offer.  Customer service is exceptional.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Spocket provides many options for in U.S. shipping and that value is a tremendous benefit to small businesses like mine.  The customer service at Spocket has been very helpful and responsive.  As a fellow small business, please do set expectations that this is not a call center but reponsiveness has been very good as I'm multi-tasking during the day while communicating with Spocket via chat.  The Spocket Customer Service model fits very well with my busy schedule and I get the expected results from Spocket.  Spocket has been a great partner thus far.  If your customer demands are reasonable, Spocket has been stellar in meeting any concerns and the customer service experience has been consistent and reliable.  As I look to expand out to physical stores across the Midwest and NYC, I feel Spocket can be a trusted partner in crossing the finish line together. Sorry for gushing about them.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I used this app to expand my inventory. I love how easy this app was to I integrate with my acct. I would definitely recommend for anyone just starting out or look to add more quality products to their inventory.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"simple and easy to use, got 1 order from them and customer service and really good, they also answer questions quickly",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This app takes dropship to the next level. Truly complete, it offers a very large number of suppliers and products.",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"pretty fair app. I wish the products were alot cheaper with statistics on the orders, import and page views. All the same the shipping time is a small win.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"It is incredibly easy to navigate! and the products are of great quality. I am a new user, but so far- it's great. I am just starting out with my Shopify store, and they seem to offer a lot of help and advice. and that's exactly what I need! I need as much guidance that I can get. As soon as I got the app, a chat head popped up asking if I need anything at all- now that's customer service. I appreciate it greatly!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"i prefer this over Oberlo, it's very easy to add items to your store. Great app i strongly recommend.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I gave it this 4 stars because it's awesome, but I'm waiting for sales before I determine the 5th star. I've sampled some items, and they arrive quickly. This is perfect for my needs. Getting items to customers quickly is important to me. I think it's worth every penny",Spocket,Shopify
4,,Easy to use so far!! The videos are very helpful in learning how to navigate the app.  Figuring out the shipping took the most time out of everything.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I used this app to do almost everything it the best perfect for a and there crew us supper friendly and helpfulbeginner like me,Spocket,Shopify
2,,"This app is just ok. It has some nice products but beware - there are a ton of products that says it's from the US, however, processing time is 7 days and then another 8-14 days to ship the product to the customers. Why would shipping take that long if the supplier is in the US? Sounds like they are labeling China products as US...wish I would have noticed this before I upgraded my plan.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Nice app Nice app Nice app Nice app Nice app Nice app Nice app Nice app Nice app Nice app Nice app Nice app ^^,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"Seems great! We're new to Spocket so we're still trying it out. We opted to use Spocket over other product importers because we have the option to choose USA-based products, and therefore have shorter shipping times.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,I really love this App. My customers are very happy with the fast shipping and the great styles for less. I recommend using this App for your store.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I love this app. The people at Spocket are very helpful whenever you have a question. They’re always willing to help.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Their Customer Service is one of the best that we have seen in Shopify's app store. They show us that they really care about us and want to take care of our concerns to make certain we are successful. It's all in the family and that is the way that they treat you--just like a loving family.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,so far socket has been an amazing experience for me. thanks for the service!!! keep it up!!!!!!!!!!!,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"Great app = quality products once u really commit to search, overall 4+ not 5 cause very little European suppliers at less in sport, at leisure. But overall good and easy to use",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"I have found the suppliers run out of stock and don't restock for weeks on end.  The products are FAR more expensive than AliExpress ..the shipping costs are extortionate.  I wish the ""cost"" would import to Shopify along with the price etc. I always have to manually go in and maintain ""cost"" on Shopify after an import",Spocket,Shopify
1,,It said 7-day free trial so I accidentally bought the annual plan instead of monthly and they charged $348 and would not give my money back. I called them within 5 mins of making this mistake but they wouldn't budge.,Spocket,Shopify
3,,"prices are a little high to purchase which means harder to sell to customers, there is not a lot of choices, unless you have the higher priced plan which can be difficult for people just starting out",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"im glad i came across this app it was very helpful with me starting my own online clothing store. I was looking for a USA dropshipper because the china dropshipper shipping is very long. I just wish they had more youthful, trendy clothing for juniors.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,They have a great selection of products and countries that ship! So far my experience has been positive.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,The app is good. I did move some products from my the app to my website with just one click and the products are satisfactory. Premium products.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I liked Spocket, the products offered are of high standards. What is missing is an order tracking tool to give my customers the status of their orders",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This app is REALLY Great. I am almost kicking myself for not downloading it before. To describe my experience, it has been Great. You can browse hundreds of products from different countries. That's One. Two. You can easily see and view the products, their descriptions, prices and most have a variety of views to see the product nicely. Three: You'll DEFINITELY want to upgrade--Really use that Trial to your advantage, don't start small Go BIG! Four: When you start the importing process, it is Very seamless and Very easy to push the imports to your store without necessarily doing them individually. And you can edit products easily. I could say more, but I think I covered the gist. Lastly; most importantly the Customer Service is 'On Fleek!' Like I had wonderful by my lovely Assistant she certainly know who she is! :-) I didn't ask her if I could mention her name--she could be ""very shy"" I don't know, but Awesome Awesome Awesome! If you haven't downloaded this app which has numerous suppliers on it...I don't know what you're waiting for (like Seriously) it's worth the price and I think the products sell themselves if you play your marketing right.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,Great app and very easy to use. You can find very good products that are shipped or made in the US !!,Spocket,Shopify
4,,Customer Service is fantastic.  Selection is good and changes/updates frequently.  I wish they would secure their suppliers for longer periods of time.  It is frustrating to have product disappear in the middle of ad campaigns.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"App is expensive, for the quality! Quality and fabric of the clothing are very cheap and poorly stitched. Not worth it but, with lack of options, moving on is hard. I do like the shipping times!",Spocket,Shopify
3,,I used this app to find items with faster shipping. I like how it provides descriptions.  helpful!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I start the test. We will see. Two days was very promising. I find the product and I build my store. I hope will be million.,Spocket,Shopify
3,,its decent app wish they had better products though and maybe a tad better prices. there are many chatsky products and there needs to be more winners,Spocket,Shopify
3,,I use this app to obtain a quicker shipping time. I still don't know how I feel about it. I can't really find products for my niche to fit into my store and the items I do find are being sold to me at regular market price. So far I've been using spocket for a little over 3 weeks and I don't know if I will continue.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,I chose this app because I am based in the US and would like to provide quality products to my customers fast in order to remain competitive on the market. Time waiting for a product overseas can really hurt niche business trying to launch. I have bought a few samples while setting up the store and I really find quality and value from these US suppliers.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"Spocket has an amazing amount of products that spans across many niches plus they're portal is easy to use.  They are one of 3 main suppliers I have decided to use based on the ease, pricing, customer service, variety and quality.  I do wish that it would show the shipping as a field as I'm calculating each products to make it easier to adjust customer pricing.  Clicking on the shipping link is an extra step as well as manually adding in the shipping for the various zones.  Hopefully, that will change in the near future but either way, I plan to stick it out for as long as I need the service (and can afford it:-)  Thanks Spotify!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Support is great with Spocket! At times there's a bit of a learning curve with setting things up properly, but they are readily available via chat and have excellent follow up/follow through!",Spocket,Shopify

5,,I use the app to bring new and exciting products to my customers. I love the uniqueness of of the products. I'm enthusiastic about our partnership and look forward to sourcing products for my pop up shops and selling marketplaces.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,I like this app. I haven't sold any of it yet but hoping that will change soon. I do not enjoy having to write a review to get the screen unblocked,Spocket,Shopify
3,,"Too many ""premium"" products. Products that actually sell, are placed in this category. If spocket wants to be a leader in dropshipping, don't force people to pay for your premium plans.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,I found some really high end products for my site. It was easy to import my items and I like the prices were already there. I can’t wait to see how well they sell.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The app is really easy to use , could be better if all the pricing details integrated with shopify a bit more , but i am just being picky",Spocket,Shopify
4,,The app is easy to upload products to my site. It links easy with shopify. I am just starting with the app so my final rating may change.,Spocket,Shopify
3,,Is ok little bit confusing but I assume is the way it is. I Like you can add products straight away,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app is very easy to browse! Great selection of products as well. Good for setting up a store with competitive - not really discount pricing unless you do a lot of product digging..,Spocket,Shopify
5,,So I waited a while to write review.  So after a month these are my thoughts.......the customer service is great! And making an order was super easy!,Spocket,Shopify
4,,Good Products!But... Images Have to be in higher resolution!Thank you very Much!Good communication With Staff.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app helps us greatly in our business. Very easy to install and use. They have a great customer service team and very helpful.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This is a hundred percent worth app, to drop ship in the USA with a great range of products and fast delivery.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,like that the products are unique and shipping times a little faster.  Would be great if you could add more australian products with faster shipping :) After using it for a week i am really happy with the service and i upgraded my subscription as they have some really nice premium products... still would like some more aussie ones but they advised they are working on it and if it is anything like their customer service i am sure they will deliver... thanks,Spocket,Shopify
4,,I live in America so finding products that are domestic rather than imported is always a plus because my customers prefer quick shipping times,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"So far I am really enjoying Spocket, they are quick to response to you. I am finding the products are nicer than the other apps out there and when they respond back to you they always include some form of help either via a link or a suggestion.

5,,"Loving Spocket, so easy, so many products and helpful support team. Definitely would recommend this app",Spocket,Shopify

4,,I like spocket.  It is easy to use.  The price is fair.  They could expand selection. I would recommend this app for online start up dropshippers.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I was using the free basic trial and fell in love with the quality of products here.  I've made a few sales and decided to go to upgrade.  I am enjoying the ease of using Spocket.

Thanks again Jonh. Keep up the great work!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"We sent a test order in and have question before we go ""live."" Irene was very helpful in a addressing my concerns via Chat.... on a Saturday morning!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I was looking for a solid and trustworthy alternative to AliExpress for dropshipping, and the fact that Spocket works with US/EU suppliers certainly played greatly in their favor. So far my experience is very satisfying, the integration with Shopify could not be smoother, and there's enough variety of products to insure an increased chance to find the ideal items to sell.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The app is very easy to use, lots of products but what i like the most is their support, it's top notch!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Starting my dropshipping store and Spocket has just made it so much easier. The best part has been the chat for help - I thought it may take a few hours to get a response particularly since I live in Australia but they reply within minutes.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I was skeptical at first though I find it already a great app but as I move forward my shop, it's the actually the best!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Just started using this app for my new store and everything is going great so far. The products look great and the selection is pretty good for not having a bunch of things from aliexpress,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This ap has many good products and some of them also have fast shipping. I can list products faster than another ap I use. The customer service is helpful and kind, and easy to access with chat. Thanks Spocket.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,This app has a variety of amazing products and discounts! The subscription is worth the price! Helpful and accurate support team as well as easy importing and editing! Love this app!,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I have not been using this app for very long and got stuck with changing some of my details,I used the chat option to get help and they replied almost instantly. They are very friendly and helpful with everything. I especially like the chat option because you do not have to send an email or call them and wait days for feedback.It is really easy to  import products to your store and change the prices to include shipping as well.   They will let you know when an item is out of stock so that you don't have to keep checking your website to make sure that you have enough stock left. The only thing that I would change is choosing my own pictures and not having to go to my store to edit them. Other than that, the app is really more user friendly than other apps that I have downloaded to my shopify, and living in South Africa it is not easy to get suppliers that do drop-shipping. So far I am really impressed with the app and would recommend it to anyone who has, just like me, Installed and deleted a lot of drop-shipping apps.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I really like this application. Customer services are awesome. They will help you with anything, just discuss it with them.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I usually Don't write reviews. But I can't help but appreciate the Spocket Outstanding Customer Support. I've been using Spocket for a month now with their Paid plan.

5,,"I strongly recommend Spocket. The app is super easy to use, I love how I can source products based on their location to offer my customers faster shipping times. Their customer service is #1 I always get a respond within minutes and everyone is amazingly helpful, I always feel like I'm chatting with a friend who is there to help me.Thank you Spockets for your amazing support and outstanding service!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Super easy to find great products and push them to your store.  Product descriptions and images are well laid out and written!,Spocket,Shopify
2,,"I used this app in combination with other apps to run my online business. I currently use 33 products from this app on my store. No sales yet. Most products are cheap and I don't mean inexpensive, they're cheap in quality. Be very attentive with the items you choose to post on your store. Something else I don't like and is the primary reason I only use 33 products is that many of the products on the app are lacking information. You literally have to contact customer support to request more information, pictures and size charts from the original supplier for each and every single product. My suggestion to make this app better, be more selective with the suppliers and products you add to the platform. Make sure there are multiple pictures at different angles, correct size charts, a description of the product with no spelling or grammatical errors and the basic facts such as what the item is made of exactly, who the item is for, what occasion can the item be utilized for, the item features, etc.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I used this app trying out a product for my store, and it was one of the most easiest app's I have used by far. I highly recommend it.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The products are great, with a huge selection AND the customer service is amazing! They not only answer questions quickly, but will check in on you from time to time to make sure you are successful. You can also find help on their facebook page at any time. Great App.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"There is a great collection of products here to choose from. When I'd get more sales coming in to justify the empire plan, I'll be changing to that to make it to where I don't need to have any caps on anything.  Something that is also really nice is the way that you are able to personalize the invoices that your customers would get to make them branded by your store.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Spocket has a wonderful selection of products in all categories.  I appreciate the help that I am given when asked and the quick response if they can help it.    So far it's going great and they are doing a great job with their selection of products and user friendly app.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,We use this app to fulfill orders for our customers. Even when in need of customer support it has been a very smooth experience. All of them are very kind and respond super quick finding solutions that make us and our customers very happy.We truly recommend them.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Possibly the biggest rip off you may experience, as soon as I installed the app to my shopify account, I get a message that says and I quote ""Give Spocket a 5-stars review here on Trustpilot about your experience and your account will be upgraded to Starter plan for FREE. ❤️""",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app is gunna change the dropshipping game. Faster shipping on the majority of items and the items are of much higher quality than aliexpress or alibaba. Vendors come from places like the USA and Russia with much better quality production!,Spocket,Shopify

5,,"Spocket is marvelous in that it is pretty starightforward and user friendly.  They are well organized, just a bit too expensive. If they can add more products for their simple plan, would be great",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"There are some things that can be improved. For example, an excel export of products would be super helpful. It would also be great if we could see reviews on each supplier. Other than that, this app is awesome! There tons of high quality products and Spocket's customer service is amazing!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,John with customer service was very helpful and took care of my problem immediately. Would recommend.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,"So far working with Spocket is better than I first thought.  They are always there to help. They always answer a chat even if it says no one is around right now.  Not a lot of companies do that.  They keep tract of your items and handle it if some are discontinued or out of stock.  I have worked with John and everyone is nice, kind and I am so glad I stumbled upon Spocket!!  Mandy!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This one looks promising with all things in place for dropshipping. Great pics, description, products, fast shipping and above all great support team. Can't ask for more Thank you",Spocket,Shopify

1,,All the distributors are selling at retail prices. I went to all the manufacture websites and i can buy the products from them cheaper then then Spoket,Spocket,Shopify
5,,The products on this are so much more unique than everything else I've run across they carry items that are a little more on the high-end side which is what I'm looking for they do have something for every budget but they are definitely meeting my needs their customer service is outstanding!  How's the concierge for more than 20 years I am absolutely a stickler for good customer service.companies a lot of companies have great products but the customer service is below sea level and I believe the customer service is part of the ambassador to the company!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Easy to use! So far we've added 50+ products to our online store. We've made a couple sales and the process is easy.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,The customer service is so very helpful and prompt when you need help. Nice quality products as well.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,"I want everyone to know this is the best drop ship app ive use so far. tried almost all the top ones but this sprocket is really making a difference for me. this gonna be my 2nd store at first i used woo with a diff app, didn't quite make it. i hope this time sprocket makes the difference",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Love it.... Products coming from US, Canada and Europe. Process multiple samples orders and got them very fast. Thank you.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,Pretty good solution. Needs better organization and filtering within the app of product lists (prior to publishing) as they are difficult to manage/sort. Also needs to force venders to offer a return policy as all the venders i've found so far don't allow returns.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,"I've just started using Spocket but it's sooo much easier than the other Dropshipping apps I've tried.  The interface is intuitive and user friendly and they have a chat option which means that help is just a quick click away!  I had a question yesterday that was cleared up with a chat within a really short period of time.  I'm really, really happy with Spocket!",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"Customer service is fantastic.  My main gripe is that suppliers ship products with their branding and I've been in a situation where the inventory was incorrect.  Fortunately, I had only ordered a sample but it did cause some concern.  I also wish there was a way to change plans myself as I have to lose a few days of the subscription for which I paid when downgrading.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I got on the Empire plan that doesn't let you sell to Amazon, Google Shopping, eBay, and isn't integrated with FaceBook. These are my major selling places, and their customer service doesn't have any idea of what's going on. I've talked to several people that can only try to give me an answer by having me wait for someone else. I went from AliExpress to here because I wanted to have an American influence, but the ended up finally being told that I would be in competition with the manufacturers by trying to sell on these platforms.",Spocket,Shopify
2,,"Ok, I have been using Sprocket since 2018 on their FREE plan which allowed 25 products worked great for me. NOW...they changed their plans and now their FREE Basic plan does no longer allow 25 products and indicates FREE forever! Therefore I am now having to uninstall due to their plan changes because under the old FREE plan I was on is no longer valid. What a shame.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is by far the only app I've ever considered paying for. Great customer service - real people on the other end! Love this app,Spocket,Shopify

5,,"This app is great, it has quality products and the prices are decent. I use this app for dropshipping.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,Not enough quality products and does NOT compare to Aliexpress. I also fail to see why anyone would pay to use a dropshipper when most of them give this service for free.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Low quality products, low quality images, and silent upgrades are waiting for you in the corner when the trial ends. If you are trying to build a serious store, this place is not for you.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This is the best dropshipping app I've used, so far! I am really new to this, so it is important that I have quality customer service, backing us; the team at Spocket exemplifies this. I love the UI and sorting features, which help to select US-based suppliers, so our customers don't have to wait for long shipping times. We haven't made a sale yet, but I'm confident in their customer service, when I need them. FIVE stars!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I used this app because it helped my find good products from the US because I was looking for somewhere to get good shipping times.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,"This app has very nice products in good quality and shipping time. Plenty of suppliers let you find your products. But I noticed that often quality of pictures is poor so it looked a bit poor in a store. also after descriptions is not full. no materials or size in description, and this is really important for customer.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,The team answers swiftly always concern making sure the app is working I love Spocket  easy to use and I am glad chose them.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"At first, I did have some concerns about a charge that was added on my account. I'm so happy that support helped me and resolved the issue for me. The only thing is that it took a moment to get to that point. After all, great products and I am a happy customer!",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"HORRIBLE!! SCAM!! Out of 14 orders I've put in, about half of them we're cancelled a day later after they realized they don't actually have stock. Which is a bad impression for my customers and poor reflection on my site. They mask the suppliers with codes ""brand"" names but they are mostly all Chinese vendors who probably also have distributors the US, Canada, and UK. ""Celeste"" for example mostly carries SheIn styles but sells them for as much, and sometimes more than the actual SheIn website. I can't reach anyone for support because when I try Google tells me that it's not a private connection and hackers might try to steal my info. They also charge an INSANE amount of money for a barely working dropshipping system. This is a SCAM!!!",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I am removing the App because I never moved the Plan I had in my old store to this new one.The support is very bad, you have to be saying things thousands of times.The clock that a client requested in Peru never arrived. They made the refund but made me lose several clients.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I used this app because it made building my store much easier. They answered my questions in a timely manner and provide a lot of resources to help get you started.,Spocket,Shopify

1,,It's a great app.......but it's kinda shady to change the features of the packages AFTER the app is installed. The price for the Pro plan on the app state that you are still limited to only 25 regular products. But on their website it still says you can get up 250 products. Which is which??? uninstalling.....,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Out of sync inventory management with shopify and suppliers, lost orders, poor supplier management, limited women's fashion products for US market with no product descriptions, extremely slow and ineffective customer service, inferior and cheap outsourced technical team that takes days to investigate and fix technical issues, and no escalation channel for urgent customer and live paid order/shipping issues. If you want to mess up your brand, hurt your revenue and push your customers away with embarassing situations on the orders, this is the dropshipping app to go for. We have spent thousands of dollars in marketing to draw customers and improve conversion rate, and as the orders have started coming through, we are facing challenges in almost every other order. We are giving this feedback so that the owner/management wake up and address their issues, compare their product with oberlo and other apps, make it better! They have potential, but have got lazy and over confident along the way.  We have tried Oberlo, Spocket and other dropshipping apps, there is huge potential for new apps in the US dropshipping market to compete and grow. Smart dropshipping app creators should take the hint and build something nice for this market.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I strongly recommend Spocket 100%. The customer support is awesome.  Irene is amazing. Every time I end up having a problem, she walks me through the situation. No need to be stressed doing business with Spocket. Go for it...",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"***WARNING*** This company uses deceptive techniques to entice customers to purchase an annual subscription. I made the mistake of purchasing the Pro subscription and choosing the annual billing option since it was more affordable with the false assumption that their 7-day ""trial period"" still applied. When I discovered that this app did not meet the needs of my business, I attempted to revert to the free plan and receive a refund, but was told by support that because I chose to pay for an annual subscription, no refund would be given. TL;DR - don't sign up for an annual plan and hope to get a refund, they will keep your money.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I've been using this app since I opened my online boutique back in March 2019. Not only do the US suppliers that I've worked with provide quality items with (usually) good shipping times, but the Spocket staff are amazing.

Thank you to Kim, Irene, Andie and all the other awesome Spocket people!!!",Spocket,Shopify

There were so many questions I had before I was going to start Dropshipping and Spocket made everything so much easier, their team is always there to help and guide you through any process.Also, one of my main concerns was that I did not want to sell bad quality products and I wanted reasonable shipping times, that is something you don't need to worry about using Spocket.

Hence, contacted the customer support and it got back to me fast and that is important for us. Although, i expected the responds to be within 8 to 12 hours. Well done!!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"They have help me so much, support it's great, great products and quick delivering times, you can't go wrong with Spocket Thank you Spocket team!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,It help me and they responded quick with every answer.  It really help me out a lot getting all of the answers that I needed.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I think they are great!!! The  items are very nice. Looking forward for sessions to come. Always friendly and helpful. Thank you Spocket!!!,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I love that you can get so many products that ship from the US. The selection of items is good, but there are some items I'd like to sell that I can't find on the app, however. So a bigger selection of products would be awesome. Other than that, the app is very helpful. Most of my store items come from Spocket. I still haven't sold anything from Spocket yet, so I can't give any details on the ordering and shipping process yet.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Very Impressed with the team at Spocket, not only do they have a huge variety to get your E-commerce store up an running. The support they provide is amazing. They go above and beyond to make sure any questions or concerns you have are answered. They genuinely care about the success of your store and they will be there help you achieve that every step along the way.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is the first dropshipping app I've tried and I'm so glad I didn't give up after a few tries because Spocket has made it so easy to dropship US products!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I used this app to help me find products within the United States so i can get fast shipping to my customers along with being able to pick from only high quality products.,Spocket,Shopify
2,,"I love the account manager! Real time virtual assistance is phenomenal! Product editing could be a little easier, like adding a link to be able to make products available to facebook and IG while in the Spocket editing. Emails should be sent to alert us that items are still in the cart and awaiting purchase for processing in case we miss the check out button (like I did). That's all for now...",Spocket,Shopify
4,,Great products at a fair price. No complaints from me at the moment.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,It's great because it has suppliers who can fulfill and ship the items within a short period of time which reduces customers anxiety! The app is easy to use and customer service is awesome! You don't have to crack your head for product description because the basic description provided by the suppliers are already well written. Most of the images (of the products) are also clear and high quality. It has reduced my time editing product photos and description tremendously!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,it is easy to use and I like that the company reaches out to you and ask your opinions. I would recommend them to anyone.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Items get fulfilled fast and easy. Customer services are also great they answer quickly.  Great app!,Spocket,Shopify
4,,A little bit of a bumpy start but I have to say that they turned it around for us! We had a couple supplier issues and the support team jumped right in and resolved the issues VERY fast. So far so good!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"There are many high quality suppliers, very transparent shipping pricing comparing to other platforms. Spocket support is just amazing, very helpful and responsive. I miss the feature of monthly invoicing for products purchased (for my accounting). Rare platform can provide this, but I think it would be a distinctive feature of Spocket for EU stores, since all of us need the cost of sales invoicing to be in place for accounting purposes.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,Don't Install this app !!!!!! Old products and don't refund if you buy premium plan. Can't Change/Cancel Subscription,Spocket,Shopify
4,,Excellent customer service that is knowledgeable and super helpful.  The items are easy to upload to your site.  I just wished they had more items to sell.  I love it as a great substitute to Oberlo.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Unfortunately I have tried Spocket for several months and even paid in full for the Premium services. However, about 90% of my test orders and real orders came back as unable to be fulfilled by the suppliers because they had dropped that particular product. This information is NOT updated accurately by either the suppliers or Spocket, or these “premium” suppliers are not properly vetted. DO NOT USE this service if you want to be able to rely on the dropshipping products offered. Trying to save someone else the money and time that I wasted.",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"Since I wrote my initial 1 star review, I have received several calls from Andi who asserts that the team is diligently working to resolve the cited issues. she seems to really care about the app's performance. Based on these conversations I am adding 2 stars and removing my initial review to give the team an opportunity to rectify the matters I cited.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Nice products but not happy about having to call Shopify in order to get my $99 refunded after subscribing to the Empire/Pro plan and I am STILL waiting around for my refund of $99 which they have refused for no apparent reason. App uninstalled and all items have been deleted from my store. I am using an alternative. Update 20th January 2021After placing my order for two products on the 6th of January to the value of £68, and thankfully this was a test order made for myself, suddenly I saw a no entry sign on one of my orders without an update, I contacted Spocket support to find that the seller who is listed as shipping to the UK does not ship to the UK and shipping price was listed at $4. So, I requested a refund. The second order suddenly had the same issue on the 19th of January, suddenly cancelled. Immediately called Shopify to complain and express my frustrations. Unfortunately, Spocket is not an app that I can recommend, too much hassle, poor communication, I had no idea what was happening from one day to the next and cannot say this is a reliable app for fulfilment of your orders in a timely manner. I am glad that the order made was for me personally and not to a customer. Too many issues and problems that will spoil the reputation of your business/enterprise.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,The concept is wonderful. The interface is easy to use. The support is great. The suppliers are from the US to w/c I can confirm after placing a bunch of orders via their app.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"We only just started using Spocket, we have been very pleased so far. The prices are very reasonable, the products are of a good quality, there's a healthy variety and quantity, and having just spent a while chatting with their customer support team, they have a good customer support structure. My only qualms are they need to ensure the suppliers themselves use a variations naming convention that makes sense.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I tried to use this app. And I suggest everyone NOT TO USE THIS APP AND BE CAREFUL. I add some items (which should be shipped from US) from this app into my shopify store. After I sold some of those those items I saw that supplier doesnt really ship from US but ships from China.My customer saw this too and asked me for refund and told me she wont ever buy from my store again..I asked spocket ""support"" to solve this problem but the only answer I am getting from them every single day is that they ""are sorry"" about this.I dont really understand how can Shopify approve such a frauds..I really DO NOT recommend this app.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Really love Spocket! Very easy to use and perfect for newbies like me. Highly recommended! Customer support is also A+++!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I want to increase my sales as I have been meaning to start my dropshipping business so I downloaded Spocket. I was able to test it out for a few months with sample orders with my other store and have received my items quick and easy.  I am looking to sell more accessories for men so it is my hope that they start bring more suppliers that sells my niche!,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"HORRIBLE BUSINESS. I signed up for yearly, but after I contacted them days after signing up to cancel because it didn't fit the right products for my store than I originally thought, they refused to give a refund of the $900 I was charged. How is this fair? I had to cancel and take the entire loss. BE WARNED. DO NOT SIGN UP FOR YEARLY.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Integrating with Shopify and other dropshipping apps like Spocket is helpful. This was easy to navigate..import, push and sell! Just waiting to get sales.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,This is the worst dropshipping APP! I would stay far away. I imported their products and had them listed on my site and was getting emails about copyright claims. I reached out to Spocket and they didn't respond. Their customer service is absolutely terrible. It is definitely not worth getting sued so I deleted the products.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I was able to make good business with generous returns and their products are very fashionable and up to date, providing my business the boost it needs!",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"This is FAKE, not serious apps, they were putting in their checkout that you have 6/7 days testing and then you will be subscribed..I just discover that they charge me all the year automatically 760euros!! I will see with my bank for fraud payment.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Update:The cancellation process is a pain. I've been trying to cancel my subscription for three days! I keep getting excuses. Make it easy for customers to cancel on the app since you charge separately from Shopify. I've read other reviews about people being charged after they've cancelled and uninstalled the app. If I'm charged, I'm going to report as fraud. Make it easy for customers to cancel without having to talk to anyone.",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"I think is a little high in price for the quality of the products. I order some samples and it was a disaster, thank God it was me and not my customers. I had the premium plan but is not worth it, use the basic plan you will be fine.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is a great platform and very simplified allowing me to easily understand the whole app contents. I love working with them.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I NEVER write reviews but I just had to rave about the customer service I have received from the Spocket staff -- Kim, specifically, is AMAZING!! My customers love the clothes too. A+++",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is the second dropshipping app I've tried and I'm so glad I didn't give up after the first one because Spocket has made it so easy to dropship US products!,Spocket,Shopify

1,,"One issue after another with them.... I loved the idea of this app. We thought that it would be awesome to have mostly US & EUR based products.... then we found out that the majority of this is also from china and aliexpress. I emailed them about this when we first began using them. Made it clear that transparency was not their strong suit and asked for the corporate email or an email to file a complaint and address my concerns with someone of a higher level and was hoping for better customer service as well. Never once did I get that email. I was referred to someone else who then dealt with my questions for the next few times. But never once was I referred to someone above the support desk level. Yes, there are some great products that come from the US but most of them also only ship to the US. So my Canadian Affiliates cannot even order those items.

5,,I use this app to find new and different items that you can't find on most large Chinese drop shipping websites. 5 Stars,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Not really from US and Europe products, many Chinese, Indian suppliers as well. This app is way overpriced compared to others.Branded invoice? I placed an order for myself and the package included self promotion... I gave a try the Pro plan for a month to realize that it take up to 5 days for shipping. I cancel but am still charged $49... Contacted support to have it refunded and really cancelled.Not recommended.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Very bad. Not even worth just the one star. If you delete this app from Shopify, Pro subscription will just start.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I used it for at most an hour and it was immediately taken off my account, while it said that you could test it for free.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Complete garbage DS app. They don't vet their suppliers.  You have drop shippers drop shipping drop shippers.  If you're in their FB group, there are a bunch of people complaining about why things are being shipped from China.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"*WARNING* - * FALSE ADVERTISING * DON""T Waste your money!!!!I don't usually leave reviews unless it's extraordinary, exception product or it's one of worst product. I am writing this feedback with good intension to help other new shop owners to be cautious about this app.",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"I didn't get to use this app as the bad reviews were like a warning sign. I did, however, contact them to have my credit card details removed. And yes they did it. So if you're seeing this and you have a problem with them billing you even after you deleted the app, I guess you forgot about recurring payment happens automatically so it might not be their fault entirely. Contact them before deleting the app and maybe you will save yourself some money monthly! I didn't get to drop ship either, so I have nothing to say about the quality of their clothes.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"just downloaded not sure what it can do for me yet. once I've tried it I'll come back and let you guys know. What i don't like is you telling me what to put in my review. OK They have rejected my review three times, I don't like to be told to lie about something i've not tried",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I used this to expand the variety of clothing within my store, there was a range of clothing available.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"UPDATE: ( since someone, the CEO? has responded to my review below )",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I would give zero stars if I could. I downloaded this for a day. I figured I would not be charged after deleting the app as many do not. They are currently telling me that they cannot refund the charges cause it's against their ""policy"" because apparently the subscription page states you have to go through the unsubscription process to not receive future charges. Regardless, this is a B.S. policy to charge people who are no longer interested in the app and have forgotten to unsubscribe/read the fine print and then justify a no refund policy. Horrible way to do business I have not encountered this issue with ANY other app.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Overpriced non-name brand products for twice the price of name brand department stores. After paying hundreds into ads, not a single sale. Thank you for the trial but I will not be purchasing this.",Spocket,Shopify

You must disinstall the subsciption with the Spocket scam website and if you disinstall the app from shopify you will be charge from them.

1,,terrible app. and if you decide to not use be careful they will take money out of your account I opened the app. and then uninstalled was charged for a 5 min. opened.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Useless if you want to share the dropshipping products on your website with your existing products as the shipping times do not correspond to the shipping times/shipping costs I have set on my webpage. Customer service didn't have a solution other than ""match your shipping times to ours"" well that's useless because my normal products need to share the same shipping times at checkout and do not take as long as in transit as yours. Cancelled the app yet they still charged me $60AUD and will not refund me, even though I did not even use the app for more than a day. DO NOT recommend.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"pirates of the high seas, the products are way to pricey on this app plus they also want shipping cost, shopify is a good platform but way too many apps are   not quality reviewed  and too many competitors are entering this game with better suppliers, shopify up your game",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH SPOCKET. The concept sounded great, US suppliers and faster shipping. We started using spocket on our store, placed orders then 5 or 6 business days later they are still unfiflled. I then reached out to customer service and didn't even recieve a reply. Mind, you this was after several hundreds of dollars were spent on orders. Total joke and complete waste of time. Your way better off with oberlo.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,"We are just getting started with Spocket, but are excited about being able to source and ship from the US and UK.

1,,"Don't be fooled. Shipping costs are super high. They dropship from Ali Express to dropshippers, taking all of your profit forcing you to have to sell at higher costs. Just google suppliers in your niche in the U.S. with the word ""dropship"" after it and find a direct link. Its usually easy to sign up and fast 3-5 day shipping with 1-2 day processing. Fu** These guys and apps and others like this that keep trying to be cloaked middle men out there. LET THE PLAYING FIELDS BE FAIR YOU ASSHOLES!! You filtering apps and easy importing are not worth this upcharge.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,I used this app to help supply my inventory! Easy navigation! It's such a great app and looking forward to see what 2019 bring!,Spocket,Shopify
3,,"On the fence. Since I started off using Oberlo, maybe I am a little bias. But come to think about it, if I had started off with this App and found Oberlo after-the-fact, I would probably greatly reduce my usage of this App. Dont get me wrong, its great for a free App, even though they charge you do fully use the site, but its functionality needs improvement. First off, charging to use your Store brand on packaging is lame, and marking some items as Premium is lame as well, as there is no guarantee that one product will sell greater than the next and it also kinda says, ""Hey, here is a few crap products to sell, but if you want the good stuff, pay for it."" Secondly, after adding products, the List Price and differs and doesn't add up even if you calculate the added shipping costs. Pay attention. And there are many variables available with no product picture. And the Product Pictures available do not sync in your store. U have to manually Sync them. And back to pricing, there needs to be a simpler way to set the prices, I ended up doing it within Shopify manually for many variants of the same product. Cuts down on time management. This is not a bad review, really, just statements on ways to improve, in comparison to a completely free App with, a better interface and more products. Hopefully I will change my mind over time.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Very good app for drop shipping in the US, UK, Australia, Canada and Asia. But the total number of products are still far lesser than Oberlo",Spocket,Shopify

5,,I used this app to help me in my Shopify store. I am getting good results. Try it for your store and get good results and customers,Spocket,Shopify

1,,I downloaded this app to support me with drop shipping and used the basic plan at first. I was emailed by Isha and offered a 7 day free trail to test the other plans. I thought that was a great offer so I decided to try it. On day 1 I was changed the annual fee which is a contradiction if free trial. I requested a REFUNDED and back to basic plan and was told they never said 7 day free trail. After sending proof I was ignored. Bad service and not trustful business,Spocket,Shopify

5,,I'm just new to this app but i really like it. Good products and good video explanations. I do like the fact that the shipping days are lower compared to others drop shipping apps.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,No contact with supplier. Have to pay to get customer support. Slow sending out. More expensive no response from support scam,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I am a new store looking for reliable drop shippers. First order never arrived could not get help from customer service. Could not get the product or refund from this company. The only email I got was rude and said they sent me an email, which was never received.",Spocket,Shopify

1,,Products continuously are removed from Spocket but you're never notified.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD APP,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I used this app,Great app and Free plan,I like only free,I would like to give 5 stars,Thank You.http://sphb.online",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"No worth it! The pictures of the items are very minimal. Not enough information about the products and the pricing are not the prices directly from manufacturers or brands. They are all from drop shippers...so it's drop shipper ordering from another drop shipper. In other words, you'll end up paying more!",Spocket,Shopify
2,,"Good customer service, but the platform really lack in almost everything needed: from UX, to information, to prices.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,It has been 4 months I have been happily using Spocket but I really wanted to leave a review today because of the spectacular support I have received on one problematic shipment recently. The issue was about delayed shipping and an angry customer. I was able to get in touch with the support team instantly and they went above and beyond to resolve the issue asap. Very thankful for that!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I've been in e-commerce for a while, but only recently starting expanding my inventory with the dropshipping model. Having looked at some competitors, Spocket comes out ahead in many ways.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"These guys scammed me. Charged me for a whole year when I only wanted a month. Not to mention, it was suppose to be free to try first. They didn't confirm the order.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,I love how everything is set up on this app.  The only thing is that Spocket does not supply much of my product line.,Spocket,Shopify
4,,I like the app but international shipping price is too much they have lots of clothing collection is great :D,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I used this app to start drop shipping from my shopify store. Very easy to use and set up. Great selection of products to add.,Spocket,Shopify
2,,"Just so you know the quantity you're allowed to push to your store is limited...on EVERY single plan which is a huge no for me. I was considering this app because of the attractive delivery times it promoted. However, a little transparency from then on how many you can push to your store would have been appropriate since these two factors are very important. It's a no from me.",Spocket,Shopify
2,,"They ship a lot of stuff from China. I'm not sure if clothing shipping from China has US size or Asian size, asked them twice but for whatever reason, they are not replying. Uninstalled.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,"Very easy to configure and get started, helps me scale the business from the ground up, looking forward to using this product finder",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"When I decided I wanted to give it a shot on eCommerce I wanted to make sure customer satisfaction was on the top of my list. Selling cheap goods from China with a 2 weeks turnaround was not an option. I was able to generate a little bit of extra income to invest on a few apps and advertisement for my store. When came time to add products, I was a little turn with ali express and started looking for alternative. Spocket came across one of the countless youtube videos and google research and it didn't disappoint me. Definitely a great option I will be using for as long I have my store up. Thanks.",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"Everything from ordering right through to fulfilment is smooth but a major downside is you have to signup to PRO before you can use the live chat which I did do and it took nearly 24hrs to get a reply - not worth it.  Stay on the basic plan unless you desperately need to chat to someone in the chat. Also, you can only offer 25 products on the basic plan thus forcing you to upgrade that's why only 3 stars!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"We use this app to add an additional income stream for our Nonprofit. Creating streams for nonprofits is challenging, but these products are a great help.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,Very friendly user interface.. very Nice produits To add To our collection..A must have for print and demand..,Spocket,Shopify
5,,The video gave great detail and the fact that I can ship from US to US makes it a plus. I used other apps and this one seems like the best out of all.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app is very apealling and the products seem to have quality. And the idea of shipping from other countries aside from China gives more confidence on the products,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Spocket has a surprising amount of products I can offer in my niche. Other dropshipping apps only had a few items, while with Spocket, I'll be able to really increase my selection and reach to my market.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,I used this app to help build my website. Many awesome products to choose from. I have my products being shipped from warehouse closer to my customers so shipping is faster.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Using this app now, seems very easy and cant wait to get started. I have been using oberlo seems like the same process but better shipping tyimes",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"I use this app to source the majority of my items, as I love being able to offer products shipped directly from the USA to US customers.Customer support is top notch, and they actively seek out feedback from their users to improve themselves consistently.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,The set up for this app was extremely simple and it integrates very well with Shopify.  I set up my store in minutes!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,THIS is a good app. it helped me get my store started. was simple and easy to use. I recommend you to use this app.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"What an incredible app! Giving absolutely anybody the opportunity to become a millionaire if they are willing to put the work in for it! I’d highly recommend for years to come! Money doesn’t make itself, you have to put the work in!",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"Most of the products are from suppliers who have bulk ordered from China. Shipping to US from the US, was expensive, at least 8$. This leaves little profit margins. 8-14 days shipping to US, doesn't exactly beat epacket for much cheaper",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I’ve had a couple of questions and a few problems starting out, but Isha was always there to quickly respond and fix whatever issue I had. So far I am very happy with the customer service and the app.",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"This app is great for product sourcing but some of the features are questionable when it comes to working properly. We has a supplier on our site and ran a real order, then when we tried to fulfill it said the supplier was gone. Support claimed it should have taken the products automatically off our store but it did not and now we cant' fulfill the order.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"The worst costumer support ever!They didnt fulfill my orders, thet dont answer my emails or messages.Dont even think about it!!!Info@ninelivescats.shop",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"Spocket apps is really good but I found out that the prices of the products are expensive. There are products that sometimes descriptions are not appropriate, no measurements etc.",Spocket,Shopify
2,,"They try hard. I can see that they are doing their best to help with issues. But they are coming up short. I've had numerous problems tracking products sent. If I want to add tracking that's another cost. The products say they are shipping from the US, but many of them are not. They are also incredibly expensive. I think there are a lot more drop shippers eating a piece of the pie. That's what the pie is so expensive. The costs for the products are not competitive. They are way overpriced. I'm giving the 2 stars for customer service.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,very expensive app that doesn't have any reviews on products and no customer support number. don't waste money like me!,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I like the interface of this app, but honestly that's where it all stops.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Spocket has been really helpful for my business. With good quality products, delivery time & Pricing it has helped me excel. I would recommend it to everyone looking to successed in the Dropshipping business.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"The Pro plan that cost $99 is advertised as allowing you to import unlimited number of products to your store. Not true, you are stopped after certain number and they demand a minimum amount of sales in order to allow you to keep adding products. This information is not shared anywhere on their site. The plan description is misleading, I wasted $99 and valuable time. The benefit I saw of using this app was having access to china (AliExpress) products with comprehensive titles and description. Saving me the time to edit AliExpress product titles and descriptions. All the products in their catalog are available on Aliexpress for a cheaper price and free shipping.",Spocket,Shopify
2,,"Poor response from support (you can tell they are under resourced), and inability to ship product either at all or from the correct country. Waste of money. Found most of their products to be over priced.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is an outstanding site. Wish I would have found it sooner. I am using several drop shippers and Spocket will definitely be one of them. They answer very quickly and are very helpful.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Spocket does a great job with their platform and the customer service is great, some of the suppliers are too pricey with shipping fees but overall they added a ton of value to my store",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I star trial with free plan.I have fisrt order from this app.Processing time (handle time) is longer than provided information.Over this rate, i contact to support via email but no one reply my email.So bad service.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Spocket has a fairly large variety of vendors offering a wide selection of products.  Like any vendor, you do have to do your research on the quality of the product and determine if the margin you are given to work with allows you to make a profit.  Some items have an attractive discounted wholesale price, others not so much and are not worth the advertising costs.  Spocket support is wonderful, responsive, and the interface is very easy to use and navigate.  If you are familiar with Oberlo, Dropified, ProductPro you wont have any issues understanding Spocket.  I definitely recommend giving Spocket a test drive.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"Added this app to my Shopify store yesterday.  Some items I questioned the quality or overall practicality, but most appear to be of excellent quality even those not part of the Premium Plan which offers only exclusive high quality products.  As to importing products, it was pretty much like Oberlo, except I do not need to specify weight and HHSTariffs for shipping.   The supplier takes care of that.   Shipping costs are also given and make sure you add this to your price.  Some items have a pretty good description (less writing to do) and most have metric and American units, so the whole process of importing to my store was really fast.  Now I will wait and see, hope my customers are attracted to these new items and start to make sales.  Everyone have a great day and let's get selling!!",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"My favorite app to find US Drop Shippers. Super easy to use and fulfill orders, and the delivered product is what it says it is. Customer service has also been amazing, anytime I have a question they answer quickly and are so helpful. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have a certain niche I'm targeting and the product options are limited but I really hope more product that ships from the US is added so I can use it even more! Thanks Spocket!",Spocket,Shopify
4,,This app is the easiest I’ve had the pleasure of using to date. Looking forward to seeing it’s limits. Good Luck Everyone! I used it to search for better quaility products and of using muti criteria to search with easy and great.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Not as expected. The system only sends review request randomly to some past customers and not all., and there is no way to find out why and trigger a manual ones for the once skipped as that calls for an upgrade and a monthly fee which I am not keen on right now. If the manual trigger feature was part of the basic this would have been a great app people would upgrade anyways as your business grows. At this point I am looking for an alternative.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I use Spocket mostly for the range of brands and products that it makes available for drop shipments. Even the free plan offers so much. Yet, I plan to jump up a tier within the next few weeks. Definitely recommended to add to one's plethora of tools and sources for drop shipping. Awesome addition to your toolset.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The customer service is exceptional,",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I'm very happy with this app. There is a wide variety of items to choose from for my store. I am now able to order sample to ""test"" a supplier out before ordering. I had an issue and customer services handled it promptly on the same day!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This App helps you to import new products from supplier from Europe, America, China etc. Very Good App!!!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,really cool !!Excellent Application,Spocket,Shopify
5,,JE trouve que c 'est génial et un grand geste pour tout ce que vous faites pour des milliers de personnes pour essayer de  développer  leur petit Business,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Half of the products I have imported don't even include all the variant photos. How am I supposed to sell a top in a color I dont have a photo of? Also, you can't remove the tags from the items you import before you send them to your store. This means you have to seek out each item you have imported once they are in your store to remove the ridiculous tags they have attached to each product. I have imported quite a few items that have upwards to 30 tags that are completely unrelated to the product. Another con is that the item descriptions are useless. Some of the items I wanted to import didn't even state what the fiber contents of the garment were. Would you want to purchase something if you had no idea what it was made of? Last thing, your monthly subscription dues are ridiculous. $29 a month to only import 250 products? And that's not a monthly cap, that's total! Then it jumps to $99 a month for unlimited imports! How does that pricing scale work??? With everything I have mentioned here in my review, this app isn't even worth $10 a month. Find a different app to import that is worth the time and money.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is a great app so far. I'm eager to continue using the app.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,It told me if i left a 5 star review it would upgrade my plan so here i am.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"just started with Spocket, but it is realy easy and intuitive. For now 5*",Spocket,Shopify
1,,I was happy to locate products shipping from the USA - some of the brands take forever to ship or update tracking almost not worth it when you have customers asking where their stuff is........quantities aren't always updated either and have left me canceling orders due to lack of inventory.  Although Spocket did reach out I have continued to have the same slow shipping problems and have contacted them on multiple occasions regarding tracking information.  Customer service is everything as well as prompt shipping times - PLEASE hold your vendors accountable on the listed shipping speed -or remove it entirely!  Currently 1 order open and going on day 3 with no tracking - these are not made to order products (this is probably the 4th time same problems) I will be removing these products. The overall app has decent products that I would continue selling if they can work out the kinks with some of their vendors,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"They basically had nothing shipping from the U.S. that my customers would want, in quite a well-known niche with a huge following.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,NICE. I love how the products are. Great service.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,very nice app pretty gud very much nic i quite enjoy yes,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"we found and only products is expansive,look",Spocket,Shopify
3,,The same products but in another country. So nothing special.,Spocket,Shopify
2,,The App is simple and easy  to use. The product descriptions are clean. The prices however are high and doesn't really leave us much room to make much profit so not worth the time. I spent 2 hours and could only select 4 products. everything else was expensive already.,Spocket,Shopify
3,,beautiful products that many a buyer would like to purchase. I'm looking forward to my partnership with spocket to increase my sales,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Spocket has been amazing for me!! I started my store just a few days ago, and added a few products to test, everything seemed to transfer over smoothly so I actually gave spocket a real shot.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,I've been enjoying the app quite a lot. I have seen great value in the products they bring to the table and have available. If you not sure about it I suggest just trying it out.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Why cant companies be honest from the start??? Spocket according to your advertising your app is free so I spent all day using your app to put products into my website only to try to place my first order and I was asked to pay £29. So is your app free or is it £29?? Why did you failed to inform me at the begin and be clear about your prices? Now what I'm going to do is, delete the products that I put on my website and go directly to the supplier site and save myself £29 a months. Why cant your firm be honest about the way it works??",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"So buggy, getting errors all the time, the products are over priced, a 3$ top is actually priced at 29$, pathetic.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"was a good place to add products from, there was a promo for unlimited pushing of products, i pushed alot, and looking to get membership once i generate enough revenue.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,"The concept is great, but the problem is that most of the best items are preferred products and you have to join a paid plan to use them. It would be great if there was more variety and better quality for the free plan items.opalorchidboutique.com",Spocket,Shopify
5,,So Far Im Loving It!!Very Easy To Navigate And Super Helpful Support,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Really good app, very easy to use.",Spocket,Shopify
2,,"Great looking products, but doesn't specify if vendor will ship internationally and what those shipping costs/turn around would be.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Irritating. That's the only word that comes to mind when I think of this app. Trying to navigate through the different categories is harder than it needs to be. For example, my shop sells men's clothing. There is a category for clothing which includes all genders and then there is a category for men which is just a bunch of random stuff. I was looking for an alternate to Oberlo because the shipping times from China are obnoxious, but I noticed that the shipping times for the clothes on Spocket are pretty much the same, but the prices were higher. So I will continue to look elsewhere. This app might be good for some niches and people who like to scroll through pages of unrelated items, but not me.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"I would give this app N0 stars if possible. I'm just starting a new online shop and because of this company's major lack of communication and priorities, my store's reputation is being jeapordized. It's been almost 1 week since I've tried to have an order fulfilled and after simply rquesting a tracking number or just a simple response at all, I've only received a couple worthless responses... NO TRACKING # or even a status update on the order. Trying to communicate with this company is nearly impossible because it's so rare to even get a single reply even though they say ""usually replies within 2 hours"" LOL! Yeah, right... more like you'll be lucky if they even reply at all and if they do, it's 2 days later. One of the employees told me that they are fulfilling hundreds of orders and that's why it's taking long. That's such a sorry, unprofessional excuse and that alone lets me know that my business means absolutely NOTHING and therefore not a priority. I've tried contacting the developer of Spocket, no reply.... SCAM, SCAM,  SCAM. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS APP!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,so far I'm loving this app :) I'm seeing so many beautiful items and products for my online boutique,Spocket,Shopify
5,,interesting app. Certainly now a says people what to shop for product make in USA or shipped locallly from the same country. I have not test the app thourghly but l like the concert. Also we an find unique products here,Spocket,Shopify
3,,"I'm trying the free version. This seems like a cool app, just wish I could preview more than 25 items on the free version. If I can move them though, I will be signing up for the paid membership.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Don't ever use this app. I'm having terrible experience from these guys. I got charged for not using this app. When I talk to them about it, they told me to refund the amount but later they denied. They are here to steal your hard earned money with a stupid app.",Spocket,Shopify
2,,"I liked the products and the prices seemed good until you look at the shipping costs.  A product selling for $7.00 retail would require a $5.95 shipping fee. making the cost to your customer $12.95.  I searched for the same product and found it on several sites that charged $.95 more retail, but there were no shipping costs - $7.95 vs $12.95?  I may have missed something here, so if I did, please correct me.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,looks like good app. having  variety of product with dropshipping options,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Very limited product line, with very high prices. Each category consists of 1-3 pages of unbranded overpriced products. Requires account setup to view disappointing product line.",Spocket,Shopify

1,,This app is still under development and needs work. It is unable to delete products from the store.  It does have better product descriptions up front.  I would feel more comfortable if the plan options included the $0.00/month for 25 items but this may only be a promotional gimmick. Another option that is needed is the ability to delete a vendor's account.  At this point it seems that there is no clear way to be sure your account has been terminated.,Spocket,Shopify

3,,"While some may have a better experience, we didn't really find products that fit with our intended market, other than many that were linked to Etsy shops. As Etsy shop owners, we weren't too pleased with seeing our products, photos, & links in the search results without our permission. As far as products directly from Spocket (non-Etsy products), we didn't see much that would appeal to our customers or fit with our brand. Having said that, I can't provide much insight to the products themselves or customer service as we didn't actually place any orders. Overall from what we could tell, the app itself was laid out with ease of use in mind, & seems that it may be helpful to some other companies.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Only been using this app for a few days so far and it has definitely been more user-friendly than the other applications I have come across. 5 stars, will update review in a few weeks.",Spocket,Shopify

5,,what an amazing app with high quality products!!  making a ton of money with them!,Spocket,Shopify
2,,Not much use for me. For a dropshipping app I don't understand the purpose. In every category I have searched all I see are orange button products (pages and pages of just organge products) where I have to reach out and form a partnership with various etsy sellers to get products for my store. I have yet to see any purple button pre vetted items I can start selling immediately as advertised. I see no way to search or filter to find the purple products in each category. If I wanted to do Etsy dropshiping I could register with Etsy dropshipping which I have done in the past. I wish it worked for me but it doesn't.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I was new with Spocket and find it amazingly useful by being able to make dealings and partnership with different sellers anywhere in the world.,Spocket,Shopify

5,,Thx for spocket really valuable,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"This app has been pretty good so far. Reminds me of Oberlo, but it puts more emphasis on where the item is coming from. Which is nice since I constantly have issues with AliExpress vendors.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Love the products and the prices.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I uploaded what I needed thanks!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Love the product selection and very easy to navigate!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is a lot like another dropshipping app I use and it makes working so easy! I love the idea of adding real quality products from small businesses to your store rather than cheap mass produced items from China.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Love the products and the prices.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,very easy to upload products to Shopify store you just select and bush to your store The Important thing you can't bid Spocket prices,Spocket,Shopify
5,,used this store for 2 days and its awesome,Spocket,Shopify
5,,it is very good for dropshipping business,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Love this app!  I love how you can choose countries for products and the info videos.  Used other apps that all use Aliexpress, didn't feel like I stood out from the crowd.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"I'm very new to this app, but it looks promising and user-friendly. Definitely excited to import some products!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Very easy to add Etsy items once you contact them. I'm glad I don't have to update stock manually.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is a great app. They have a lot of high quality products to import. There are a bunch of products from Etsy that you're supposed to get permission to sell. Would be nice to have more of these already.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Just signed up and loaded product into my store. Very easy to install and the product selection is great and reasonably priced. Look forward to a long and beneficial relationship.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,i would definitely recommend it,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"New, innovative and a good sales channel",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Its good, the products  high quality",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Its good, the products seem to be way higher quality and it has a good selection.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,So glad i chose Spocket for my shop!! this app has really help the growth of my Website and clout!! Thanks for the recommendation Spocket,Spocket,Shopify
1,,I was very disappointed with this app. Sprocket's products come from Etsy sellers. I wouldn't mind that at all except that they expect ME to do their work for them and contact each seller myself in order to sell their products.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is exactly what I'm looking for! This app is easy to use and I like the products featured. I want to have a mix of original items and licensed items to sell in my shop.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,They have a wide variety of products. I would recommend them.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,My impression so far is great and its easy to use it. Im looking for more products.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,It's been OK so far. It makes it easy to find and import unique products that you can't find on some other sites. Margins aren't as good though the products are higher quality. Shipping prices from Canada and Spain to the US are high. Please inform those suppliers.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I'm liking it so far. It makes it easy to find and import unique products that you can't find on sites like Aliexpress. Margins aren't as good but the products are higher quality.,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Products in Spocket are so expensive, most important is they have the original retailer's name or website water-marked on each product picture. Basically, Spocket is not meant for drop-shipping, it is for advertising for another shop. Please change your app description to something else instead of drop-shipping because why would any body buy stuff from my site if they could go get it cheaper on the original online store.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,nice app for beginners am making a good profit out of it thanks you Spocket,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"Spocket wants you do their job for them. They want you to convince 80% of the product manufactures to join their network. There is no point in using this app right now. Maybe try again in 6 months, it does look good but it is not ready.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,"The app looks great, hope to make it useful for finding top quality products. Thank you!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Very unique products. Easy to import. Love this app!!!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Very Good Products and Easy To Push Products to my Shopify Store,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Wonderful app absolutely my favorite. must have for e commerce,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Looks pretty nice so far as I am just starting my online shop.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Wow! It's something that I have been dreaming of and it comes true! Now I can linked up so easily without having to do it manually again. Wonderful and awesome :D,Spocket,Shopify
5,,So far everything looks great and I love that I can add things to my store that ship from the US!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Nice app ! really usefull ! Good to offer a different offer to your customer,Spocket,Shopify
1,,"If you search the products on Etsy, you can see that all the products offered in Spocket are usually more expensive than the originals. And that is before the markup you have to include for shipping, profit margin and Spocket fees. Anyone can right click on the product image and Google search the product and find it for way cheaper.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,So happy this is available.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"So far, neat product. Great idea behind the app.",Spocket,Shopify
1,,Would be great if the etsy shop owners actually knew and agreed to this app. Since you have to contact each and every shop owner to get permission to sell their products what I have been finding is they can't do this. They all seem to not even be sure why I would ask and that they can't accommodate. So it seems the app randomly pulls people's products out for important without their knowledge then you have to hope to get lucky with a vendor who' interested in this. So far I have 7 no's. This very much like cold calling for a supplier,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I'm so glad I found this app! Been looking for a place with great quality products + easy integration and automation. Spocket has done that perfectly!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Very happy with this download - they have more personalized/unique items than the other apps I've previously used.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Offers a wide collection of interesting and unique products and a well designed UI to easily import to your store.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,This is one of the best apps that I've had the opportunity to use. It has help me gain a lot of sales! :),Spocket,Shopify
5,,"So far, works great. It imports variants and descriptions. I hope it updates stock when the item sells from the supplier.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,The app is easy to use to locate your products.  I'd recommend adding additional search features to allow locating particular products - otherwise a great app.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,It works well for us in the UK.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,I start using Spocket and they have simply the BEST variety I could not find anywhere else,Spocket,Shopify
1,,It worked great at first but now it seems like you have to contact each and every shop owner to get permission to sell their products?  How much more work you need to do now just to add products in your shop?,Spocket,Shopify
3,,"This app allows you to find awesome products from amazing sellers but for some reason it won't allow me to access my import list, everything loads EXCEPT my import list where I push the items to my shop.",Spocket,Shopify
3,,"Worked great at first, but stopped working and won't search products to upload anymore.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,Spocket has one of the best products i have ever seen. Highly recommended!!,Spocket,Shopify
2,,Going to have to give this a low ballpark at the moment purely because the 'free' plan isn't great in comparison to other tools out there. Especially with the lack of features it has.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Love it! I use it for importing all kinds of products for my niche, and it works like a charm!",Spocket,Shopify
5,,My wife and I have been researching products on Etsy and were thinking how great it would be to have an app to help with dspn from Etsy and here it is. Its a great app I highly recommend it. Also the support is very good. I had a question and it was answered within a few minutes on a Saturday evening.,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Looks great so far! I was able to filter the suppliers by country, which is super important for me.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,It's really easy to use this app and seamlessly integrates products from Etsy. Love it!,Spocket,Shopify
5,,"Seems good so far...just wish the limit was on active listings.  I imported a few just testing out, deleted them, now i've hit the 10 import limit and i have nothing listed.",Spocket,Shopify
4,,great app very helpfull. everything is extremly easy to use. only downside is the free version only lets you import 10 items a month then its 29 a month unlike oberlo that is always free,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"Like that Tags automatically populate. Transfer of product titles symbols that represent ""inches"" and ""feet"" could be better.",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app opens up opportunities. The support staff is very responsive. I had several concerns when starting to use the app and they were addressed right away. It's important to reach out to Etsy sellers first I believe before you start dropshipping their stuff but this is a really great way to connect and fulfill orders. Thanks Socket team!,Spocket,Shopify
4,,"Awesome app, you are the best, and free also. very very good work guys. thank you. thins are beautiful to find",Spocket,Shopify
5,,This app is great... When I have a question Zac is right there to help... I have made him work for his money....  But he has helped like I am the only one in the list... Easy to use nice short videos to get started... Awesome,Spocket,Shopify
5,,Rajendra was very helpful and patient. my needs were met and I am really happy. best customer service so far. thank you.,Alidropship,Shopify
1,,"The service is terrible. i have 3 order with the Appreaker, none of them are shipped. At the time i order, the items are not out of stock. But after i placed order, they told me the items are out of stocks. This meant the system is not updated and synced. I have also requested for the refunds many times, but more than a month i still haven't got my money back yet. when i ask they kept telling me that i will get my refund. All i can cay, it is terrible service",Alidropship,Shopify

1,,Negative stars for this app. I uninstalled the app from my Shopify store only to be charged again. Terrible customer service. Very rude and couldn’t even speak in complete sentences.,Alidropship,Shopify
5,,"I was frustrated when I could not process my customer order of Appfreaker supply. I reached out to the support team through the chat with us now. Razi was the agent assigned to me. He was exceptionally helpful guiding from the beginning to the end on how to process appfreaker supply order. He did not end the chat until I was able to order the items. His was very patient and I am so glad he was the one assigned to me.The reason why I was not able to process the order was because I selected ship to Canada, which made it impossible to add the items to the cart. So, Razi explained to me that it does not matter if I change the shipping country to US since the shipping address on the checkout page will take precedence. I tried his suggestion and I was able to add the items to cart and eventually placed the order",Alidropship,Shopify
5,,"Really love all the options of importing in this app. Rajendra the customer representative was very helpful in explaining the plans available and how to use the application easily. Responded quickly and very professionally.Thank you, Rajendra !!",Alidropship,Shopify

1,,"I wanted to give zero big zero marks and negative 10 if there would have been in rating. Last 3.8 years , the CEO has not been able to resolve the auto Sync , It never works, works for 30 minutes , and then stops. They killed our businees due to no sync alongwith Shopify . No support , No  Auto Sync. They only promise to resolve but they could not resolve last 3.8 years. A horrible dropshipping company with horrible staff support and horrible CEO, they do not even listen you, they do not escalate, they say that you cannot connect to CEO and manger . I have never seen such horrible dropshipping company. Avoid joining in future , else all will suffer badly. I need credit 90 % for 3.8 years back as fine to this company . Shopify must ban such company who has made auto sync never working last 3.8 years. Never take services of this company if you want to do well in drop shipping. Most horrible company , most horrible services with no auto sync at all.",Alidropship,Shopify
1,,I would give -0 stars if I could. Sorry handling of orders. I placed a order two weeks ago and was giving false information several times about why my order has not shipped.

I NEED MY MONEY BACK...I gave them more then 3 chaces....you will waste your time adding products and they will charge you and fool you around, when you try to contact them about the bad quality of pictures and how the app would not do the daily products sync or any sync at all.. and It wont import the exact same thing. If you import something from Amazon, target or walmart. You willl see the shity quality of pictures and the quantity on your inventory would show zero... they will just fool you around and waste your time by saying let me send this to our technical team and contact you in couple of days..It's better Adding a product manually than doing it through this App..Don't say in reply that it's because of covid-19.

1,,"I downloaded this app needing to input 10 products to my store from Aliexpress. They have different plans ranging from the basic to enterprise. Even though I didn't need it, I selected the enterprise plan to see which features they had for my free trial. I forgot to cancel the plan until the trial was well over so I contacted their support team to request a refund. They told me that they could allow the refund and asked me to contact Shopify to process the refund. I did so, and Shopify contacted them back for approval. They then decided to conveniently deny my refund request.  If you want honest customer support, these developers are sorely lacking in it.",Alidropship,Shopify

1,,"Installed this app couple of months back..initially these guys responded well when i was using trial version but after i took paid service...raised so many issues with them and every time these guys would say some one from tech team would get back...and Guess what nothing happened...We faced so many issues like Auto Sync was not happening and these guys repeatedly kept on saying Firstly,that there was an update going on at their end and after that the app will work fine and Secondly after addressing same issue again...they had new version that aliexpress was making few updates and after that it would work fine...but even after waiting for so many days nothing happened and then i had to manually sync every single product....Then I had issue with some of the products , with Selling price was not being shown with margins i had set up at backend..they kept on saying that the matter had been forwarded to tech team and some one would get back...again nothing happened even after waiting so many days...end result..I deleted those products.Again I raised another recent issue that by default my store currency is Indian Ruppee but when I am adding the product it picks USD as default and the correct pricing is not coming up...again when i spoke with them on Sat day i was told that because its SatDay and Sunday the tech team is not available , some one would get back on Monday. Even after 2 days i.e today on wed day no one bothered to get back on addressed issue and i contacted on their live chat ..the guy on live chat said its their lunch time and they would get back after 15 mins...after almost half an hour with all the disappointment i had to write them that they are the most unprofessional people .I could have written this review after cancelling my subscription but then i thought to check their work ethics and professionalism while keeping this app (as i have already paid for the month).I have started using other apps like Oberlo and EPROLO and they have been quite helpful so far, at least they revert back if an issue is raised unlike these people who dont even bother to get back.I would never recommend this App and would like shopify to have a look on this matter",Alidropship,Shopify

1,,"This is my 2nd review after using the app for a month and while I gave them 5 stars previously based on my initial experience with a support person, I'm going to provide an honest and in-depth feedback about the app this time. The app has great potentials but there are some core functionalities that simply DO NOT WORK as it's supposed to! Either the function does nothing but claims to be working, ie. pops up a ""successful"" dialogue box but nothing actually happens, or it's completely out of sync with Shopify thus make managing your products list impossible. Even something as simple as SORTING doesn't work. They do have a 24/7 chat support team who are polite and are willing to give you instructions, but tends to over promise and under deliver on solutions that depends on their tech team who cannot seem to resolve a handful of fundamental issues over the past 4 weeks! Worse, some functions that were working before, will suddenly stop working and their tech team will claim that it's never been the case in the first place. After reading quite a few reviews here that gave the app 5 stars (same as I), it becomes apparent that the rating isn't about the app itself, but was simply a feedback on the initial support experience, which was also requested of me after my first interaction with them. As I mentioned, the support team is helpful and polite, but if the app doesn't work, it's kinda pointless and misleading to give the app a high rating, luring potential new users to pay for this app as opposed to other alternatives on the market. I've been in touch with their support everyday for the past 4 weeks, including weekends, and was promised at least twice a week that the issues and bugs I've raised will be fixed and that I will receive email updates once tested, but that has never happened. I was also informed two weeks ago that these issues have been escalated within their management team and will be red flagged as high priority, but again, the promise of fixing everything by Thursday 11th Oct was broken, which lead me to writing this review. Now I've once again been promised that ONE of the main issues, the CORE FUNCTIONALITY of being able to UPDATE existing product details (titles, descriptions, variations etc.), will be fixed by next Monday (cuz their tech team doesn't work on weekends). As a paying customer, the fact that they've started charging me for an app that's NOT WORKING, is somewhat inexcusable, but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and wait till next week to see. If at least that problem is resolved, I will revise my review and up my rating to show that at least some work is being done. But until all the problems and bugs have been fixed, I will refrain from giving this app a 5 star rating.",Alidropship,Shopify

4,,I have not sold anything yet so just going with 4 stars for now. Had some help from Razi. Quick response and answered all of my questions. SO far the app seems to work well.

1,,"Also in the settings of this application there is an optionOn Product delete/inactive (Unpublish from store,   Set Out of Stock, None)I selected - Set Out of StockBut for some reason they decided that they have the right to hide goods. I created thousands of bugs in indexing my site in Google.Before publishing the applications in the APP Store Shopify check them?This application does not work for anything1. An Auto Updating System to Keep your products pricing and stock up to date - Not Work!2. On Product delete/inactive  - Not Work!3. sort button - Not Work!",Alidropship,Shopify
3,,"We've been using this for a few weeks now.  Here are the pros and cons in our experience:PROS:- It does what it says it does, MOST of the time- It will save you time- Base cost is from $5 which is great value in consideration of the time it saves- Support is prompt and 24 hour.CONS- For business, it is just not user-friendly or reliable enough, yet, as follows:- It is SO SLOW to refresh screens.  Our business is on a 50Mps connection so it's not our end.  Seriously, you will be banging your head on the desk.- The Next Update Time auto sync counts down the days to the next product price update...but goes into negative time??  It is not clear whether the prices on screen are up-to-date or not.  This makes us nervous.  The advice from the support people is to run a manual update.  This works (most of the time) but we have over 100 products so it takes forever to run manual updates.- It can't handle products where the Ali-store has different prices for variants within the same product.  Not many products are like this but we have encountered issues.- The search tool within the app is inadequate and mind-numbing slow- Although support is good, they tend to offer 'beginner help' before they understand that you are familiar with the app and have a more complex need.",Alidropship,Shopify

Sai was very patient and gave me the help I needed to immediately get over my problems. I highly recommend this app.",Alidropship,Shopify
5,,"Perfect and smooth experience with this app so far, although I think it would be even better if they provide a function that allows us to download the photos directly from the site (and thus allowing a better image quality too), so I do not have to download another app just for this purpose.

If I search for Drones...it retruns drone parts.  I can't see expected shipping times, or sort by expected shipping times.  It doesn't deliver on what is promised.  I opted for the highest version out of the gate, thinking that I would be able to drop ship from suppliers other than Aliexpress....but the plugin just allows you to skim data from other existing web sites and list it on your own...weird.",Alidropship,Shopify

5,,"In a moment of panic I reached out to the Support team for this app and they were beyond great. I was able to immediately get on a chat with a Support agent who was patient enough to walk me through each step of the process for using the Aliexpress Dropshipping plugin. I was mislead by a step in one of the training videos, and they spent a good amount of time helping me through the process until I understood how where I went wrong and how to get back to right. It's great when a plugin has useful and relevant functionality, and makes your operation easier, but it's even more a testament when the support is accessible and helpful.",Alidropship,Shopify

1,,"I never really used the app because I don't source from Aliexpress. I have been going back and forth with them and Shopify billing about being charged $5 for well over a week now. They claim I installed the app back on Mar 8 and uninstalled it on Apr 6th. Then, again in May for one day (which was really a few hours because I was boiling the midnight oil) while working on my site. To my surprise, I was billed $5 on my Jun for the app! Contacted them and Shopify billing, but there response was that a I had the app for almost 30 days (which I don't believe because Shopify automatically bills in monthly increments) and installing it this one day made a charge. I don't care about $5, but it's the principal that they choose to go back and forth when there is clearly a billing issue! Oh well, guess this review will let others know... clearly a 7 day trial IS NOT free! One star based on the fact that I'm arguing about $5. Don't care if the app works or not; I don't source w/ Aliexpress.",Alidropship,Shopify

Support is immediately available, and they stick around until your problem is solved or they get back to you. I've used their live chat support on two occasions, both were pleasant experiences.2.

3,,"The format of this app is confusing. It seems like everything is all over the place. I would consider restructuring this app. My biggest gripe is that I still have to manually do a little tweeking on my website after importing products. Sometimes when I import products there's missing variants. Prime example, I would import a product that has 8 different varieties to choose and when I check my website there's only 5 varieties to choose from. Oberlo is more organized. What I do like about this app is the prices are reasonable, import 100's of products and unlimited orders unlike Oberlo if you want unlimited orders then you have to upgrade to the $79 plan.",Alidropship,Shopify

The support videos could answer a few more things up front - the app is simple and the videos are also simple, but I would recommend making all the changes in the Chrome extension before you import.  Also, it works better if you don't have another review app installed - it comes with this and imports the reviews from AliExpress, which is an awesome feature.  Kind of like using a Mac if you are a Windows user - it's almost so easy you can't do it.",Alidropship,Shopify
4,,Rabbani was very clear and helpful and solved my question immediately.  I have no fear of making a mistake with the guidance of their excellent support.  Well done!!,Alidropship,Shopify

I was having some teething problems when adding my items but cannot fault the support from these guys. Nothing is too much trouble. Anything I have asked them to do they have done for me. Even things that aren't standard, if you ask them for something custom they do it immediately. They will chat to you live on Skype and make sure that you are happy with what they have done. I am new to Shopify and don't want to be spending a lot of money up front. This app is perfect for what I need. Highly recommended!",Alidropship,Shopify
5,,Excellent app. App works great. Its easy to import the ali products. Their support and help is really nice.It's recommended to all shopify merchants.,Alidropship,Shopify
1,,Terrible. Glitchy and complicated. Nice try but the AliExpress products are terrible and CCFC. Wasted way too much time on this app. The platform is terrible and this app is not ready.

1,,"SYNCEE makes the client believe that the app is free and when you cancel the subscription they want to be charging you $ 79 to be able to uninstall it, 3 months have passed they still have not reimbursed me the $ 79 that they stole from me, they are THIEVES",Syncee,Shopify
5,,"I have used other dropshipping apps like Oberlo, but this app has been a huge help and far and away the best supplier app! You can easily find suppliers that ship to specific locations, pricing rules are very easy to use and efficient, and product syncing to the shopify store is extremely easy. The only suggestion I would have is for them to find a way to add Automated Shopify collections to the app, but this is a minor detail that doesn't take away from the app at all.",Syncee,Shopify
5,,"Syncee works really well with a very smooth order-to-delivery integration. The product/supplier search function is very easy to use with many filter alternatives. I have tried many different sourcing apps and Syncee is by far the best. Combined with a very swift and friendly support, Syncee gives an outstanding user experience.",Syncee,Shopify

Otherwise very happy with the app!",Syncee,Shopify
5,,"I'm very happy with syncee app, It's very easy to find products and import into my shopify store, 500 products for the basic marketplace plan it's ok to get started, the next plan for 10.000 products it's a bit expensive, I think there should be a cheaper plan for 5.000 products instead of jumping directly to 10.00 products next plan.",Syncee,Shopify

5,,Great Help from customer service. They helped through the whole process setting up the feed manager.,Syncee,Shopify
1,,"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND SYNCEE. Don’t make the same mistakes I did. Though the app started out well with only a few issues the first month where there were items uploaded with no pictures or items discontinued for months, according to the supplier when i contacted them, yet they still uploaded them to my website and I had to delete them. I ended up having to cancel due to repeated issues regarding the inventory updates. I had to cancel 4 orders in less than a month directly related to the app not updating the inventory for my suppliers and showing hundreds in stock when in fact there was none. The support team said it was the supplier and the supplier said it was Syncee. Needless to say when I had to cancel 2 orders in 24 hrs for the same issue, I cancelled my subscription 2.5 wks early and deleted the app, cutting my losses for the rest of that month paid. Now, 5 days before that month ended they charged me another $129.00 for yet another month even though I had cancelled over 2 wks early. Now i am having to go back and forth with them to get the money refunded. After just over a week they still have not. UPDATE - The people at Syncee are not willing to refund any portion of the month paid stating that the issues were with the supplier and not them. Issues that if they knew they had they should have fixed before uploading to any of our websites. These errors cost me 4 sales totally almost $1000.00 but apparently its my problem and not theirs. I guess as long as they keep the $129.00 they could care less how much I lost. Though the app seemed like a great thing to have and worth the money at first, if you start having issues, even if it cost you sales, don't expect them to let go of any portion of the sales they made from you as a customer. I found its easier to do it myself and wish I had to start with and not made the mistake of trying to use a service like this. Besides, I found one of the auto feeds from the supplier was only $30/month and the other was free since it was only an Excel file manually uploaded…..so I basically just gave them $100 every month for what cost them $30.00 to do. At least now that I am doing it myself I know the information and inventory amounts are correct and it only take 5 mins of my time daily. I have found many, many people have left reviews with the same exact issues. I wish I had read them. Live and learn. Though I went through the Shopify Support for emails between myself and Syncee. It didn't stop Syncee from continuing to send me emails outside of the support, asking me to reinstall the app and give them a 5 star rating. I don't understand how they can be more concerned with their ratings and keeping the money than customer satisfaction which we all knows can go a long ways.",Syncee,Shopify

1,,AVOID AVOID AVOIDIm not impressed like the other poor reviews it worked well but then the feed stopped. Did we get an apology no we nearly fell out with our supplier as out of stock items were being blamed on them when in fact the feed had broken. the customer service clearly dont care. We then asked if they could upload data via there feed they said yes but it would cost extra yet it does say free setup and support. So it is not only enough that they get there subscription but pure greed the want more. We are now actively looking for an alternative. Customer service dont care Money money money So to update this is the response from Syncee the owner got in touch i explained the issue and have heard nothing. No apology no explanation nada. Since then they are now saying for me to have my orders updated 4 times a day they want 129 euro a month to add insult to injury they are blaming shopify for the feed not working. They say if you use a compare at price then there feed can not work. I also asked why is the owner who initially emailed me now not following up the answer is too busy. Do not waste your time most supplies have a feed and you can have chaperons options than these,Syncee,Shopify

5,,"Really helpful staff, thanks to Imre who helped me alot as I am new to dropshipping. Spent a good while with me to get everything right.",Syncee,Shopify
1,,"This app used to work well, now the team does not care and they make huge mistakes, like changing you fullfillment centers when no one asked them because they don't know how to use their own software. They also DO NOT CARE about their customers and they don't take responsability for their mistakes. Their app has not worked really well for months now - we finally decided to stop using it and continue with MANUAL updates as it is less time than using these guys - DO NOT RECOMMEND unless you want Nightmares. They also refused to refund when their own members of staff made mistakes.",Syncee,Shopify
5,,"The customer service of Syncee is AMAZING! They always response fast like WOW. Also for every problem, there is a solution.",Syncee,Shopify

This process is very fast and helpful to us!The support is really helpful and always tries their best to solve my problems.I can recommend it to everyone who wants to manage their products automatically.,Syncee,Shopify
1,,"UPDATE: response to you... Actually NO my CSV file IS CORRECT If you look at my site now its PERFECT just the way it was supposed to be. YOU were not doing it correct.. IN FACT there are MANY items we didn't even have showing in my store.. Second... its 2:43am go figure you are responding to me now... almost 3am Pacific Standard time.. so yes that's true yet again... you strung me along to keep taking money from me KNOWING you couldn't do the job that I and my new team did in 20 minutes. It wasn't hard. It was so easy it made me very pissed that you couldn't get it right. I looked back at when we started together and its actually be since Jan 2020 so its been almost a year that I have been dealing with this from your company. YOU FAILED ME. You could just own up to it and admit you and your team couldn't do it correctly. I want my money back. You know you couldn't do the job correctly. I have photos proving that I emailed you guys multiple times telling you that your dropship vendors are not responding and NOTHING was done about it. I have been VERY patient but now im done. Im done being nice.. you can be a good business person by admitting that you have struggled with this for almost a year and admit your wrong doing. Instead you made me believe that my file was bad and kept having me check in with you weekly to get this fixed non stop. It was a botched job and you know it. FOR THAT and for the money I shlepped out to your company you owe me a damn apology if not my money back. Hell id consider removing this review. I have 300+ emails with my constant issues, PAGES and PAGES of chat threads of my issues. How can you even come here and pretend to the world otherwise. Unreal ........ People watch out...  I hate to leave this review but I had one of the worst experiences I have EVER had in my life with ANY company with this company. FIRST- If you live in the US this company will really be hard to deal with because they are not in the US so their times that they can help you are VERY late at night . I have been up till 3am countless nights waiting for them to help me through the issues and because of the time difference it was VERY inconvenient. SECOND- while they did try their best to help me on what I thought was a hard task because this has been literally MONTHS of dealing with issues it turns out it wasn't difficult at all in fact once I figured it out how to do it yesterday it took me no kidding 20 minutes what took them FREAKING MONTHS and they STILL didn't get it right. I ended up cancelling my subscription and now im doing it myself. INSANE ... I am so beyond pissed that I wasted 9 months with this company messing up my product feeds etc.. THIRD - we have shoes in the store that have the word "" hidden heel"" in the title because that is the style of shoes. This app would HIDE my freaking shoes that had any word ""hidden"" in the title. They tried to blame my vendor turns out NOPE it wasn't the csv file or my vendor is was them. I have a new company now and they laughed at the ridiculous amount of crap this company has put me through and let me warn you now... THIS IS NOT the company you want messing with your store. My feeds are so screwed up I had to deleted over 8000 shoes in my store and now im fixing everything with my new company. The reps were nice and I know they meant well but the lack of knowledge of simple CSV file uploading is not there. FOURTH- I tried several of their dropshippers ALSO a ton of problems with them too. They either charge WAY more for shipping than what is listed in the account OR they dont answer when we have orders. I wrote Syneee about these issues and they said "" we will contact them for you"" Know one ever got back to me so I refunded 10 orders because of these issues. I don't think they screen their vendors. So with that being said... good luck Syncee.. You stole me of my sanity for 9 months, ""Stole"" my money and ruined my store.",Syncee,Shopify
4,,The app is a little hard to naviagate but their customer service department is awsome! They really take the extra steps to help you and try to make sure you have all the expertise you need.,Syncee,Shopify

1,,"When I first downloaded this app I was impressed but the cold reality of issues was yet to surface.  This app has no way of integrating or monitoring shipping costs and no way to combine the costs in an easy manner.  You will literally have to monitor each product with your team or by yourself.  I have had to cancel over 3k worth of sales due to issues with this integration app.  I would encourage you to read these reviews and HEED the warnings. or you will find out as I did, the hard way.  The response listed below by the team does not apply and further confirms my review.  You must add a fixed price.  Well that is an issue because pricing from their suppliers could drastically change.  Adding an extra $50 fixed may make sense for an RC vehicle but it would not make sense for a TV in which shipping could range $100 or a toothbrush $5???  If you see the response that is all you need to know.",Syncee,Shopify

5,,"Hello Dear Syncee TeamYou are just a great team, I am very enthusiastic about the great job you are doing. I had some problems because I'm not very familiar with the whole thing. I always got a quick answer and help from you. The nicest and BEST thing was that you Roland Osan always stood by my side and arranged everything for me. Many thanks for the mega super job. Continue as I can and will recommend you guaranteed. There is a clear 5-star rating from me.",Syncee,Shopify
5,,"Very good app., easy to use, Peter is very helpful and always there for any questions, thank you for everyone who shared making this app., I definitely recommend it",Syncee,Shopify
5,,"Syncee's customers service is the best! Very quick response and friendly as wel. I am a supplier and they really take the time to show the listing to me, so I can tell them how I want it to look. Very happy with them, thanks a lot!",Syncee,Shopify
5,,"First of all, I've read the many reviews and to be honest, the reviews that people post with a 1 star rating are incorrect. People need to understand that Syncee can only use the data that come in from a feed. If you you are missing fields or data, then that is the fault of the actual vendor creating the original file and not Syncee who is just pulling the data. As far as support is concerned, they are amazing. I have been working with Roland who has mapped and even made some customizations to my feed and all this while I was still under the trial and without taking a penny from me. Once they got my feed setup, I then subscribed and support has still been amazing. I am running a store with over 1000 items and to be honest, I thought this was going to be a long process but wow, these guys quickly got this going. I honestly don't know how those bad reviews could have even happened because you have 14 days to get it figured out and they will even do test runs with up to 30 products until they get it right and not once did they pressure me to buy a package. I bought it because I see it working with my own eyes. To be more exact, all my 1000+ products all have 4 variant sizes and multiple colors and they still got it working perfectly. So Roland, and support at Syncee, THANK YOU!!!!",Syncee,Shopify
5,,really it's one of the great apps. and have great options. it helps me import and update products from complex xml services. great job!,Syncee,Shopify

4,,"App works well, can require some assistance and learning. There are some features that I think would improve the app but all in all it works. customer service is excellent, replies quick and has always assisted me with my issues.",Syncee,Shopify
1,,"If you like paying for literally nothing at all, then this is the app for you. Its says it has suppliers feeds ready, what they dont tell you is they use basic feeds, brings in the products in junk format, automatically pulls in new products from the feed - so you will end up with junk store full of garbage because of the way it brings them in from the feed. They make it sound very good, but the reality is....its absolute junk! They take the money straight away, I would suggest this is because they like to rob you before you realise what a pile of dog poo this is. Bring in products with just one image, even though the wholesaler has mulitpule images available, but only in paid feed - they dont make this clear at all. It updates products overwriting previous edits etc. Its a scam and I am suprised Shopify dont manage these apps better, stopping companies like this charging money for something that doesnt work and is NOT what is described by the app sellers at all. Avoid at all costs, unless you like wasting money or ending up with a store that imports junk files and messes up your site everytime new products are ran. Limited to ONLY ONE AUTOMATIC RUN per day, so good luck calling your customers to tell them they just brought something that actually went out of stock hours ago! You can run manual updates several times a day with some plans, so if your doing it manually, just import the update feed from the supplier and dont give these robbing sods your money! SCAM!",Syncee,Shopify
5,,"Magnificent...! Great application. I just started to use it and it defenetly conviced me. You did a great job guys with this amazing tool, thank you !!!",Syncee,Shopify

1,,"DONOT BUY OR INSTALL THIS THING, this app is not recommended at all, fist of all they will take your money,just by installing the app and even if you need support from them,they will not reply you just killing time to charge you and its costumer service is disgusting, I advice every one to stay away from them this is just to rip you. off, addiding product to your store will cause glitch and slow down all the process, its just glitter gimmick to take your money no more, it's easy to get 5 stars fake review anyone can try it and end up with the same result which is non professional support and software is just cannot do what they promise you, even their product prices are higher than market ,you can directly contact these supplier and add products no need for all these head ache and middle man to charge you extra for a service that you will not get,  I don't know how shopify allow this happen in their platform.I already contacted you and you denied shopify email to refund me and now you are blaming shopify for the charge, I think this is something shopify must have a clear policy and answer as this is totally not good for shopify as a respectful company and platform.",Syncee,Shopify

Thanks to Syncee for producing a great App.",Syncee,Shopify

4,,"I'm just getting started with this app. The customer service team has been fantastically helpful, and in fact they have done the uploading for me.

1,,"If I could give less stars I would, customer care took days to respond each question I had, and when I chose a company and had questions, The customer service team still did not respond at all.

Over all completely disappointing a waste of days of work and a waste of money.",Syncee,Shopify

This is actually my 2nd go around with your company the first-time customer service wasn’t helpful at all so I canceled but still had to pay 29.00- never even did a import with syncee . You advertise and send emails how easy it is with importing products, That is the main reason I gave you another shot on your Syncee Supplier Exchange they list a few of the suppliers that I have accounts with that I would be able to import with the click of a pic/product. Not they aren’t coming up in the search data field. Think I spent my last 29.00 with Syncee. it let me post if I gave 2 stars",Syncee,Shopify

The price of this app is a bit steep for new shops, but I would say that the time it saves makes it so worth it.",Syncee,Shopify

5,,"Great service and setup support!  Syncee did a trial with me via chat, so we could quickly determine if a good fit for us. The mapping is straightforward and easy to configure. The app will work well if your vendor data is consistent and ready to import.   If you have lots of product attributes and options it will not support that because of Shopify's inability to manage complex and multiple product attributes.",Syncee,Shopify

5,,"Today i found this fantastic app,  the guys here couldnt be more helpful getting my business off the ground.  They bent over backwards to make sure i got what i needed.  I was not sure how to import, i spoke to them and they got products in for me!   This app is the best dropshipping app by far.  The subscription fees are reasonable considering what they offer for the price.  Thank you so much for everything syncee",Syncee,Shopify
5,,I tried out Syncee App and it was very good. Very clean and easy to use. It's advanced field mapping and flexible product updating functions will allow me to integrate my future plans with much more certainty. Thank you for making such a highly demanded App.,Syncee,Shopify
5,,"This is simply a Super App! My shop has a relatively big inventory of fashion and luxury items which I receive through daily feeds from my partners. Every day I have to upload inventory file(s) containing hundreds of changes (new products appearing, old products disappearing, variants changing prices, quantities, images, etc.). Uploading my inventory on a daily basis through the standard Shopify csv upload is simply out of questions. It can take up to 24 hours! I tried some other apps, but wasn't very happy with them or simply they would not cover my needs. What I love about this app is that it actually creates new products in Shopify (not just sync prices and quantities as most apps will do) besides having all the features I need to manage highly volatile inventory files coming from all sorts of vendors. The App runs fast and smooth without hiccups.It can be easily set-up. No need for coding at all. And the customer service is exceptional. Special thanks to Imre who solved some issues I had (with my source files, not the app) and set me up in minutes.Yeah, its not exactly cheap, but if I had to do this stuff manually it would cost me far more, besides driving me crazy (and the very few alternatives I found are not cheaper either).",Syncee,Shopify
5,,Great app! Saved me lots of time. Imre was also very helpful with support.,Syncee,Shopify
5,,"One of the best apps we used so far, thanks syncee for your support I am happy with the app, i hope you keep the good work up",Syncee,Shopify
5,,"As a Shopify Store Owner who is dropshipping and looking to scale, we simply could not run our business without Dropified. Comparing alternatives such as time consuming staff processing that is prone to error & human interpretation, the relatively small fee of Dropified is easily justified with a saving on staff & overheads. Can highly recommend the Dropified app software, you will thank me for it later. Kind regards, Sharnee",Dropified,Shopify
1,,"I Migrated from Shopmaster and this was the first app I tried, and what I can say after 3 months of utilization is that Shopmaster was way better and way cheaper. it is hard to rely on this app to manage your business and I will look for another app.",Dropified,Shopify
1,,"Beware! Absolutely painful and frustrating experience with a bunch of lies from the developer every day. We migrated from ShopMaster to Dropified on a commitment that they would import and map all products. 14 days have passed and all they have given us is false information and commitments. Would certainly not recommend this app as this has been our worst experience with any Shopify app by-far. An UPDATE: The app was installed on April 13, 2021 and till date, May 18, 2021, the developer has not been able to fix the issue. What makes it worst is the fact that the developer is charging us the subscription fee while we loose revenue and customers due to their fault and a letter to the CEO has not fetched any results so far. UPDATE on 25 May 2021: Given the flawed app and the incompetent staff, we finally decided to cancel the subscription and remove the app. Well to our surprise, the app doesn’t even allow you to cancel the subscription and keeps on fleecing you. We had to write to Shopify to get rid of this app.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"using this app and its ok but have some sync issues with ebay when trying to update tracking , they are working hard on it now",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Excellent brand, amazing company, 1 of a kind for sure. support is top-notch and the product is legit, they are #1 app in all of shopify/",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I signed up for the Private Label plan last year, and have been really happy with the options I have to create and distribute my own brand without high overhead or the need to find/negotiate with vendors for things like supplements. Customer service is very responsive when I run into issues or even just have general questions about the process. Overall I've been very pleased with my experience using Dropified in general, as well as their premium Private Label services.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,I have been using this app for over a year now. I especially love how simple the order automation/product importing are despite the bugs (which happens in all other software sometimes). Customer Support is superb. I have used other apps in the past but nothing beats what Dropified can do! I just wish that Dropified would at least have Amazon added to your list of Order fulfillment automation store. It would be great if that happens!,Dropified,Shopify
4,,"Although I am fairly new to Shopify and Dropified, so far I really like Dropified. I like this app because it offers more stores I can add products from. For example, I use AliExpress and eBay a lot and Oberlo does not have eBay as an option. That's the only reason I use Dropified. What I do not like is the 8% fee. I did not find this out until after I had a few orders placed. If business owners are paying $17 a month to use Dropified, that should be all we have to pay!!! I will continue to use Dropified for now until I find another app with no fees but have the stores I like to use.",Dropified,Shopify
1,,"I canceled my membership with you the second day of the trial, and Uninstalled the app on Shopify. So WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU EMAILING ME ON MY SECONDARY EMAIL ABOUT BILLING? This app is not for me. You need to delete my credit card info NOW!",Dropified,Shopify
2,,"Like others have said, they suddenly changed their pricing where they made it under the guise of a cheaper monthly plan, but said plan now takes 8% of every sale/ order using their automation, which adds up and gets VERY EXPENSIVE very quickly and eats up a lot of your profit margin!!! And we did the maths. Even on our smallest store, in January 2021 (mind you, the slowest month of the year after holiday shopping... so not much orders) where before it would've been $47 for the monthly plan, it was $99.03 when all those 8% fees added up. And what's disgusted us the most is the fact that the did all this with no notice - no email, no blog post, no chat notification, NOTHING! We only managed to realize all the fee's and charges about a month and some in after they sneakily made the change, and had to contact support just to figure out what's going on. Support had the audacity to say they ""didn't bother with notifying users and just grandfathered people onto the new plan"" with this 8% fee. And 8% for order automation your competitors are doing for free (well no fee cuts)? Already in the process of migrating to a new app. Dropified was one of the best for years, but guess it's time to move on.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,This is an awesome app and so easy to use. Thank you Dropified you have changed my life. Thank you again,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Fast response time. so far i am building store can not comment on shipping process, but platform is easy to use and so far good",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Great service. Thus far, they have been very supportive of me and my business and have helped with every question, and helped me launch successfully.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,Happy with the service that Dropified provides. They have been a tremendous time-saver in locating US dropshippers and make the process seamless.,Dropified,Shopify
1,,"This app was the best in its niche. However, before the plans were $47 a month for a builder plan, but they have changed it to import plans which is only $17 a month but an 8% per product price fee. So if you are serious about a big dropshipping business and spend a lot on aliexpress per month like I do, then this app is VERY VERY expensive. My two stores that currently have the old builder plan cost me $47 a month, with this new plan style I would be paying $800 per store a month. For my new stores, I can no longer use dropified. Extremely disappointed to say the least, pure greed.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,I am new to dropshipping and I find your Dropshipping 101 very useful. It gives detailed training on all functionalities of the app as well as insights on the dropshipping business. Totally recommend!,Dropified,Shopify
1,,very bad app they charge me $17 in the trail period please refund my money !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"So far it seems to be performing well. Dropified Black is a great program, highly recommend! Other integrations besides AliExpress would be welcome (hint,hint)",Dropified,Shopify
1,,"ABSOLUTELY NOT. We've used Dropified for years and loved it, but all of a sudden we'd have to give up 8% of product costs without notice. Terrible service found a better app already and are switching. NOT WORTH IT.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Of course, I will give 5 stars because it does the job perfectly and don't understand why people moaning about it. This is the best app for integration and also getting products from all over the world. I love it. Keep it up, guys. Well done. Thank you.",Dropified,Shopify
1,,If you are curious about this app watch a youtube video about but do not install until you have method to make it work for you! Oberlo is a way better platform! This platform is all over the place and lacks basic customer service! The app was not helpful to my store. This app needs a lot of work they really should make cancel the subscription an easy process. All they had as an option was to pause the subrition which would cost $12 a month. Clearly all they want is your money! There help center said as long as I delete the app then I will not be charged! I find that hard to believe because they also say if you do get charged i will need to contact them to get it resolved. Sounds like they are praying to trap someone who doesn't pay attention to there month charges. Why not just make the cancelation process a one click of a button process. All I'm saying is I better not get charged from this platform.,Dropified,Shopify
4,,"Dropified has streamlined so many processes from cloning/adding products, adding suppliers, placing orders, auto tracking & excellent customer service and tutorials. I was exposed to Shopify years ago and now, I cannot imagine Shopify without Dropified. It just makes it that simple.",Dropified,Shopify

The training that goes along with his application lets me know they REALLY want you to succeed. You should really get this app.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"This is the best dropshipping app period. I really love the customer support and the features which no other app has especially the callflex and the tools like aliextractor, photo editor, and the academy of course.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,I use this app to push products to my Shopify Store. I like it because I can easily see the suppliers who will ship the products faster. What I really like about it is it allows me to see the link to my suppliers by just clicking a tab.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,I use this app to load products from Ali express. It works great for importing products into my Shopify store as well as edit products.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I'm so glad I was pointed into the direction of the Dropified app.  It has made adding products to my store a breeze.  Dropified has also shown me several US dropshippers that I can use so I don't have to rely on only China dropshippers.  I am going through their dropshipping academy to learn as much as I can and it doen't cost extra. The monthly fee is nominal to what all you need and would have to buy separately. Dropified gives you so much to work with and make your store look super good and run efficiently.  They have an awesome help desk of seasoned specialists that can help you with advice, sending you an article on your question or can do a quick video to show you how a task is done.  I would of given up a long time ago if I didn't have Dropified to lean on.  Shout out to my man Greg B. who has been most patient with me and very knowledgeable and helpful always.  He is never condescending and always encourages me to take advantage of all that Dropified can do for me.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"This app has helped me set up my store. I have used it to search for products, track inventory, and fill orders. The access they give to different suppliers is amazing. I still have a lot to learn about this app but I feel that the help videos are really great help. I just need experience with the details of this app to run smoothly. I am new to the dropshipping business and Dropified has made me feel more comfortable with setting up and managing my store. I am very satisfied with Dropified and I would highly recommend the app to anyone getting involved in this dropshipping business.",Dropified,Shopify
4,,"Dropified helped me while I was selecting the wholesale dealers I needed to choose products from. In addition to this, the one-click feature helped me a lot. It would be great in case they could offer the same capabilities they offer for US based dealers for their Canada counterparts (like wayfair!)",Dropified,Shopify

5,,"Dropified is an excellent app and worth the $47 or more per month easily.

Yet in general its a very smooth app and by far the best app of its kind.   Solid customer support as well, easy 5 stars.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,Zmieniłem aplikację z Oberlo na Dropified bo mają dużo bardziej rozbudowane dodatki i naprawdę fajnie to działa. Jedynie poprawiają rozszerzenie na chromie bo coś szwankuje im lekko ale wiem że jak to zrobią to będzie już super aplikacja do zarządzania sklepem. Gorąco polecam.,Dropified,Shopify

Once I migrated to Dropified my build process was accelerated by nearly 21 days. I was able to complete in 4 stores in 24 days with Dropified after spending 45+ days to build the previous 3.,Dropified,Shopify

3,,"App is really helpful and love the features especially how easy editing the product photos. The downside I notice that the products do not sync properly all the time especially the inventory that I have to delete and re import the product to make it work.  Reported the issue and was informed forwarded to their proper department but until now it is still happening and its random on any product.  Its really troublesome and time consuming that you have to redo the work. This was 2 weeks ago. To be a paid recurring monthly subscription, I think they could do better.",Dropified,Shopify
3,,"The application is better than Oberlo in some features but when it comes to very essential features then you will find some bugs which I have reported but they every bug I find and I report they tell me that it will be send to the development team and there is no estimated time to get it fixed which gives me hard time to dropship my products I choose.First Bug: I am using Australian Dollar as my currency and everything is set up based on this currency as well as my aliexpress account. when you import a product through the extension you can see the price in australian dollars but when you press more options and advanced to see the break up price for each variant, it shows in USD which ruins my calculations.",Dropified,Shopify

5,,"Dropified hands down is the best ""service friendly"", communicative, helpful app with reflex responses to questions that I have ever seen in the internet era and I've seen it all. With this kind of service you don't have to be the greatest but guess what? THEY ARE. Their platform is smooth, no glitchy weird stuff in setting up or using. They address problems and fixed them before they happen. When I have ""operator"" errors meaning I create them, their LIVE people pop right up and guide me through my inexperience on the app. I never trusted the dropshipping method in e-commerce in the past. I am only participating now because I know Dropified has my back. They are not a greedy corporate entity trying to take advantage of the little guy who's trying to make a buck to pay the bills. I strongly recommend Dropified. Stay away from GrooveKart. btw: THANK YOU DROPIFIED.",Dropified,Shopify

4,,"This app might be great for a store that is just starting, but it requires so much work on my end to get it set up that it just wasn't feasible.  For instance, you have to manually enter the product reviews CSV for every product. And again, moving inventory from Oberlo to dropified - you guessed it - is done one item at a time. You cut and paste the URL from aliexpress and basically override.  I have over 3,000 products in my store.  To spend 5 minutes on importing and setting up reviews for each and every one of my products would take 15,000 minutes, or 250 hours, or 6 weeks at 40 hours a week.  How is that feasible? It's not.  Too bad because for the limited time I tried the free trial I was very impressed.  It's like Oberlo on steroids.  If you haven't started your store yet, or have a small inventory, this is the app to use.  There are too many benefits to list.  But if you're already running a fairly large inventory, you'll need another full time staff for 6 weeks to get it done.  Not realistic is it? Crying in my disappointment.  #letmeplaytoo",Dropified,Shopify
3,,I think it is too expensive.  It is a good app but if you have 2-3 stores you are paying $127.00 per month.  That is a lot.   It should be less expensive like around $25.00 per month and a better deal if you have multiple stores.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,It's a very helpful app for dropshipping automation it's simple and easy to use interface with one-click import products.,Dropified,Shopify
1,,"Decided to try out Dropified with the ""free account"" and its completely useless. Can't import anything even after installing the Dropified Chrome extension. I'm all for offering a service for a price..my only disappointment is that if you're gonna offer a free trial, at least make it a functional one so that owners can at least see the platform in action before making a decision.",Dropified,Shopify
4,,"I used this app to add a few products to my shop, they have a wide list of compatible websites that work with the app, dropified really made adding products easy, very useful I would recommend.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Really easy app to use, you can always get help when you need it, step by step instructions,  l love this app",Dropified,Shopify
5,,Definitely  a great software for all us Dropshippers hopefully you will enjoy at as I do making mi life easier,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"very easy to use , amazing training , everything we need , need additional strategy for facebook ads , you already very helpful but for beginner, we need more breakdown like how much we should put budget to test product.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,I have used this app for close to two months now and really like it. It takes a lot of the complication out of drop shipping. I am very happy with the amount of automation that is built-in. This app is a huge time saver and worth every penny that I pay for it. I also like that they are always adding new and helpful features to make it even easier to conduct business.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"App perfetta,molti fornitori da poter scegliere i prodotti, facile da usare già col piano base, Suggerisco vivamente",Dropified,Shopify
1,,"I use this app to fulfill my orders, but it didn't for me it cost some money and time and its hurts to the bottom of my heart.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I used this app recently and found that they are great. I got an initial phone conversation to get me going. Later I got answers via prompt chats on the many questions that I had. They make doing business with AliExpress a lot easier for beginners like myself. Also, I found their courses (videos) to be of immense help.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,Takes a lot of the early headaches out of startup. Gives you more free time to concentrate on branding... I'll be using dropified from now on!,Dropified,Shopify
4,,"Best customer support compared to the competition, and actually put shopify to shame in that regard. I've used the app for 5 weeks now.  Overall, in this modern age of high IT functionality, Dropified could still be significantly better in being user friendly - there is still a lot of time investment for the customer to set up auto functions and even placing code into web pages HTML. Would like to know how reliably up to date the Dropified 'US Products' search page is and the page title is misleading because most products are sourced from Aliexpress (China) ...",Dropified,Shopify
1,,"The app makes it mandatory to set the (Compare At Price) for all items imported via the app, even if you're not planning for a sale. This problem stems from the pricing rules page. Their only offered solution for addressing this is to disable the compare at feature from your e-store theme settings--a solution that would not make my clients appreciate the discounts I'm offering, which is kind of a new problem. That's besides the fact that I couldn't find any feature that can allow me update the prices of my imported items in case I decided on markup changes within the pricing rules. Too basic for many stores.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I have been using this app for the last 2 weeks to handle the collection and management of drop-shipping products.  It has built-in support for Shopify with heaps of great features like margin handling, auto price adjustments, image selection & editing, etc.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Es un herramienta bastante útil, hasta ahora me ha funcionado muy bien, dan soporte técnico de forma rápida. Espero que siga funcionando como hasta ahora!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"It is quite flexible and resourceful. I like being able to bring over products from AE and eBay and manage them all in a single place. Still working my way in understanding how to use Boards, but in all it has been a good experience. 100% recommended.",Dropified,Shopify
1,,"Very very disapointed. I had great expectations finally found out that it was a total scam! The app is Aliexpress focus. So if you are expecting to export smoothly products from Walmart or any other retailers...forget about it!! Lot of  bugs. Sometimes you try to import product it just does not work. I've upgraded my plan in order to have several stores but the app takes time to integrate new added stores. So when you want to import products to new added stores, the stores doesn't appear so you just can't import. Other point is shipping. You need to check by yourself if the retailer ships internationaly (while other like wholesaledeals or big buy make it very easy to know as you can filter retailers using their shipping solution). Other point you don't clearly see the wholesale price. It's nice to say you can change price of the products but what about profit margin ?? You have to do everything manually except if you're using aliexpress. I should have never signed up. Never! What a waste of time & money!",Dropified,Shopify
3,,Unless you dropship from  Aliexpress or Ebay its a pretty tedious process. A couple of the retail vendors that you can import from dont work such as LAShowroom and Fashion Go. The aforementioned vendors only sell their items in packs or with minimum dollar amount per order so unless you are selling wholesale clothing to retail customers in bulk those particular vendors are rendered useless. Also the lack of material information for non automated vendors makes it hard to use the site unless you are using Aliexpress or Ebay which has automation. Overall it's a good app but I won't use it long term.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I used to build and design websites for my clients when I had started a business back in the early 2000's. I was pretty sharp until I became ill and the illness caused problems with my memory. My memory is getting better as I am better now. Things are so different now. Everything is automated software, and there's hardly any coding. I actually made it harder for myself when I joined the Dropified family. I was amazed by the auto-order fufillment, advance editor tools, the marketing techniques with the YouTube videos, the easy connections of my products to my website, I get to have up to 5 stores, and if I have a question, the team is there to answer within minutes if not seconds. There are features I have not used yet because Dropified has given me so many to choose from. I know how much software cost! With that said, KUDOS to Dopified!",Dropified,Shopify
1,,"Não sei como tem coragem de cobrar uma porcaria dessas ainda. Não consigo fazer nada. É tudo travado e só fica carregando. Não consigo colocar as variantes, fazer os pedidos nem nada. Simplesmente inútil. Ainda bem que existe o Dsers.",Dropified,Shopify
3,,"This has to be a joke! I spent 2 hours synching all my products just to reallise this App DOES NOT SUPPORT GLOBAL SHIPPING RULES you have to take Epacket or otherwise its what the supplier choses. NO WAY TO SET GLOBAL SHIPPING RULES.This app is advertised as fully automated, no?!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"When I heard of an app that could automate the functions that normally take my time away from searching for products or finding new and creative ways to market them, I was all aboard. Dropified has a huge database of videos and written as well as one on one help. My problem is that I have to work on following the tutorials instead of jumping around. I am new to the world of business and I find that Dropified is a solid ship(ping experience.) Everything you need to learn whatever you need is provided along with tons of support.Cheers!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,what i like in this app was the costumer support that i can ask questions that i encounter on my journey as newbie on this business.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I love Dropified  easy to import products & fast costumer service. Special Thanks to Kevin for always helping even if it's sat, sun, or late like right now. Already twice he came to my rescue if i'm correct probably more then twice. i 100% recommend this app",Dropified,Shopify
4,,"Nous utilisons cette app depuis pratiquement 2 ans. Il persiste quelques améliorations a apporter au niveau de la gestion des stocks. Ils ne sont pas toujours justes et surtout peuvent se mettre à zéro à n'importe quel moment. Nous travaillons avec 1 seul vendeur et avons donc retiré l'option de tracking. Cela a réglé le problème pour nous mais je sais que d'autres shops galèrent pas mal avec ça. A noter, une très nette amélioration du service client ces dernier temps. Réponses et résolutions rapides. C'est vraiment très appréciable :)",Dropified,Shopify
5,,In my honest opinion and through over 2(+) Years of being a Satisfied Customer...,Dropified,Shopify
5,,Great app for importing products from suppliers.My go too tool to import products on the fly. Has alot more advanced features that I am coming to grips with but this app does what it says on the tin.One click ordering and fulfillment and lots more.So far its been worth the monthly investment easily.Any new and existing business will love it.5 stars,Dropified,Shopify
4,,"Dropified is PERFECT for someone who lives and work in USA or for those who use ALIEXPRES,but for Europe...I am sorry i have to cancel my trial version,the platform is greatMaybe when you have a bigger list of suppliers in Europe i will come back.Also for the future,PLEASE CONCENTRATE ON MORE SITES for updates,not just ALIEXPRES. Anyone who wants to start a dropshipping business needs this feature for the his suppliers. Having 500 products,lots of them with variants...Is imposible to track them all manually.Thank you very much.",Dropified,Shopify
1,,"This was the best DS app back in late 2018. I switched over from Oberlo. I'm not sure what happened but it's full of bugs now. Orders don't fulfil, there's variant issues, the city doesn't fill, the auto captcha doesn't work sometimes, and many more. I've been in touch with customer support (Their team is great for the most part) for months now and there's been no fixes at all. I even tell them about bugs that's been plaguing my experience for months and they just tell me it's not on their roadmap. Which sucks considering I'm paying $127 per month for this service. Updates come out, they introduce new features which are hit or miss for me personally but they don't focus on the core of their business, the apps functionality. With the app not even working as advertised, everything else doesn't even matter. A lot of my time is being wasted tinkering with options trying to get the app to do what it's supposed to, fill orders. This shouldn't be the user experience. I understand bugs happen, but it would be nice to know that they're at least aware and working on fixing the issues rather than waiting for a lot of users to complain and then do something. It's like my $127 doesn't matter until 50 other people also experience the same. Eagerly waiting for another DS service to introduce an Auto Captcha feature and I'm done, unless they can fix this app which I highly doubt and I'll gladly change my review.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,I'm surprised I wasted Time after I used it for my store (EVDAA.COM) to give one of..oh I believe it's the best helpified app lol a lot to dropship quite soothing to use and surprisingly supportive I would go on for ever ..this is the best there is keep revolving. Note* DROPIFIED has one of the best friendly app features.,Dropified,Shopify
3,,I have learned so much from Dropified. This is great software and they provide excellent educational resources through the Academy. At this point I would only recommend Dropified for use with Aliexpress products and advise a little bit of caution if your planning on using Dropified with Ebay which is why I am only scoring it a 3.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"This is the best app I've ever used, hands down. Perfect for drop shipping and auto fulfillment, easy to get the hang of it, saves me hours of time and it's quick compared to the previous fulfillment software I had been using. Loads of great tutorials, and you get a full blown a-z drop shipping course as part of your subscription...worth every cent in my opinion. Highly recommended!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,Adding Dropified to my system was a godsend.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,Dropified,Shopify
4,,"It definitely is superior to something like Oberlo. The functionality is far superior. You can order easily from Ali and Ebay, create bundles easliy, even from different suppliers and the photo editing abilities blow anything that Shopify has, replacing any need for having to have something like Photoshop. It does have a high learning curve and price tag, and doesn't handle fulfilling orders from independent suppliers as well as I would like, but it saves a whole lot of time in order fulfillment opposed to doing it the old way. IF you're doing any kind of volume the cost should pay for itself. If you're just starting out, the price might be prohibitive. But once things get rolling for you, Dropified is a clear winner.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Dropified is the platform that I based my dropshipping store on. It takes the time sucking tasks and makes them a cinch. Anybody with a computer background can easily maneuver and set it up. The support team is hands down one of the best that I have ever encountered. I have passed along the information to friends that I have met in my travels with nothing less than a thank you from them. I don't know what my future holds but if it is going to include another store, it will be nothing but Dropified for me. Try it, you'll be glad you did.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"This is a great app, it’s more than I’d usually pay but it saves a lot of time and work so it’s worth it!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,The best app ever. Best team behind it too. Yes there is sometimes little issues but they are resolved in matter of minutes.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Very efficient, easy to use and a reactive customer support.We have optimized all the automatic orders with Dropified without any trouble.Very good app ! Congrats !",Dropified,Shopify
5,,We're very happy with Dropified. We spent a lot of time looking for import solutions and tested a few. Dropified is the winner and we have imported over seven thousand products and counting. Support responds in a timely manner and overall it's great value. Looking forward to what the future holds as well.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I have been using Droppified for well over a year and it's great! I appreciate so many things about this app; I use the photo editing feature to clean up product photos a lot! I have learned ""bonus"" tips from the help videos, for example how to pay for multiple orders in Ali Express at the same time (saves time and bank transactions:) I like to think of it as a ""self parking car"" I just sit back and watch the automation work. I have not had any problems and when I do have a question the support is always there and they are so patient and happy to help. (Even if I have a question that should be for Shopify they try to help) There is a lot to learn to do dropshipping well and Droppified is an essential tool to becoming successful. I have recommended Droppified to several friends starting out. Great app. outstanding customer support and loaded with great features!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"You can't really sell on Shopify without using an automation app to help import product details, import reviews, and fulfill orders.",Dropified,Shopify

5,,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I am using Dropified since 2-3 years now. And I can confirm that their App is  THE MUST HAVE to automate my dropship businesses! Dropified team is extra! I needed their help several times and they were always there! Reactivity, efficiency to help, great attitude always, I really can count on them. And they are always investing to improve  the app by adding new options and partnerships and trainees to help dropshippers to increase their revenues and stay updated. I hope that it will other dropshippers like me for their success",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I have been very impressed with the automation Dropified offers. It saves a ton of time. Also, Dropified has training support that has been very helpful. Streamlining operations is the heart of dropshipping efficiency and Dropified has been a huge help. Various functions on the dashboard have been updated and improved recently.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"This app is great, takes a little more sophistication to run, but is a lot more powerful than it's competitors. Highly recommended for all drop shippers!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Excellent app that I've been using for over a year. Well thought out and versatile. Terrific support, too. Highly recommended!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,These guys are real I've seen how they have developed this app with their customers in mind and it's just gone from strength to strength - especially their integrations - just amazing,Dropified,Shopify
5,,I have been using Dropified for about a year now. They are just as good as Oberlo for fulfilling items in Ali BUT they have so much more!!!!They offer so many other features it makes them very worth the cost! They are continually adding value to their app!,Dropified,Shopify
5,,I use this app for all of my Shopify stores. The product import and order fulfillment is extremely easy. The most important is support. Always there to help me. Totally recommended,Dropified,Shopify

5,,Have used this App continually.  Enjoy the convenience and ease of use.  The hardest part of this review was getting 100 characters.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,Awesome app if you're dropshipping from Ali. Lots of really useful features to keep track of orders and far far better than the competition in my opinion,Dropified,Shopify
1,,this is bullshit. i cancelled my subscription here and still got charged. this app only wants your money. dont try installing it or you will pay them even if you dont like it! Scammers,Dropified,Shopify

1,,"App is good but customer service is not so good. I have been charged twice for 7 month (both by shopify app + Dropify app). customer service fixed the bug and when I installed the app second time, I was charged again by both parties. Time consuming to fix all that, I asked customer service to give me an offer as an excuse, they refused. They don't care about customers, they only want you to pay the app. Sad...",Dropified,Shopify

C'est plus qu'agaçant.J'ai fini par abandonner mais je suis déçue sincèrement.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"ten times better than Oberlo. There is support in French, it's greatten times better than Oberlo. There is support in French, it's great",Dropified,Shopify
1,,This app use to be amazing but ever since they switched a lot of their policies and plans it went to complete crap. For someone who owns multiple stores its simply not worth it paying their high fees when I can simply just use other apps that I need the same features for way cheaper. Wouldn't recommend if you own multiple stores. Seen a lot of my friends switch over to different apps since dropified implemented these new plans.,Dropified,Shopify
4,,"I use this app with Shopify, It's very usefull! I need to pratice more and get the informations to learn more.Thank's",Dropified,Shopify

3,,"Très bonne application, indispensable. Nous constatons toutefois une dégradation : tous les matin, nous rencontrons des problèmes de serveur. De temps en temps, c'est ok, mais là cela devient récurrent. De plus, pas mal de choses ne fonctionnent pas bien sur la duplication de fiches produits : prix par variantes, stock, photos sur variantes.Enfin, le fullfield sur bundle ne fonctionne pas non plus. Tout ceci n'est pas très grave mais cela pourrait être amélioré. Hors, nous avons déjà remonté ces infos depuis longtemps et rien ne s'améliore dans les updates.Cela ne remet pas en cause notre utilisation de l'app mais nous trouvons cela dommage.De plus, la dernière mise a jour a enlevé une fonctionnalité qui était bien pratique : pouvoir entrer un n° commande hors Aliexpress (bigbuy par exemple).",Dropified,Shopify
4,,"Easy to use but it can be better, But I prefer free app. so I will stick with EPROLO, fast shipping and free to use.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,Best app for automating the order fulfillment process!Plus tons more features to help any drop shipping business.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Very impressed so far. Mostly so with the variant mapping feature. I have many custom variants, such as S - UK 6-8, M - 8-10, L - 10-12, L - 12-14. Oberlo did not let me have 2 variants linked to L, whereas this does. Also tested the ordering and it works like a charm!",Dropified,Shopify

5,,"I started my journey with the free plan of Oberlo and it was OK, but since switching to Dropified I can tell it's really way better than Oberlo!!! It's so easy to import products, push them to the store, fulfill orders, etc.. The Auto fulfillment is so convenient that it allows fulfilling a lot of orders in a very short time. But the best of the best is the quality and effectiveness of the Customer service, I really suffered from that with Oberlo because nobody answers your questions... Keep the good work!!!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"It is really the best app for dropshipping, from researching the products, load them in Shopify, editing, upload them to Facebook... and the training, customer support is outstanding. Let's come on board! It worth it!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I've been doing the 60 Day Challenge and this app makes it so easy to find and add products.  I am so excited to get my dropshipping business going and Dropified is giving me the confidence and knowledge that I need to get that job done!

Finally, I am finding the confidence, and knowledge, to set up my store, find products, learn some technical aspects that have kept me stuck, and get ready to launch a great business!",Dropified,Shopify

Still adding products, no doubt. ;) If you're serious about your business, I definitely recommend this app to be among your top choices. Best of luck!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,If you're a drop shipper this is the app to use. Works with several drop shippers around the world and most US based. You can even bundle products from different drop shipper and sell them as one bundle product (premium)!  That alone is worth the premium price in my opinion.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,This app is fantastic.  It has so many great functions and the training videos are very detailed and easy to follow.  Dropified is well worth the investment.,Dropified,Shopify

5,,"I LOVE this app! Its like Pinterest for your business! I have only been using it for a few months, but it is my go to app everyday! Not only do you save lots of time not having to import individual products into your store with all that goes with that, but you can organize your products onto boards for future use/ideas. It imports the original info + gives place for you to customize each listing and then you can send onto your desired store. You can have multiple stores connected in one place, which is a huge time saver. Dropified also has so many links to a variety of dropshippers here in the US and abroad. This app also helps keep up with price changes from suppliers. I highly recommend this app!",Dropified,Shopify

5,,This app is amazing! It helps me do everything I could ever want and more! Plus the guys that run the app are super knowledgeable and are more than forthcoming on information on how to make my store better!,Dropified,Shopify
5,,I was using oberlo until I stumbled upon dropified and the course they are hosting for 60 days. In this 60 day challenge intensive work has been done through dropified and it’s given all the features I needed and more. From great photo editing to simple and clear work space organisation with product boards and easy tagging options. It’s simple to work with and has never given me a problem in the last month and a half. The support team is great. Fast and steady replies for anything and everything you have a question about. Definitely the best app I’ve found by leaps and bounds!,Dropified,Shopify
5,,I love Dropified! I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for an advanced platform where you literally do it all in one place! Cropping images? You got it! Sourcing out top sellers? Boom! Advanced image editor? OMG! Dropified can be overwhelming for some people but take some time to learn the ropes from the tutorial and you will be a pro in no time! :),Dropified,Shopify
4,,This app has been great helping me setup my store with aliexpress. It has a few quirks here and there but nothing that affects the overall functionally.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,Excellent app. Highly recommended to everyone in the dropshipping business. The integration with Aliexpress is awesome.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I just love this app!

5,,This app saved me hours of working!!! You have much more options here than oberlo.. top app 5 stars!,Dropified,Shopify
1,,"Im currently on the Premier Plan paying 127 per month and literally nothing works properly. So far the support has been nothing but long reponses and when I do get one, all they say is to clear my cache. Tried it over 10 times and it doesn't do anything. Ive been using dropified for like 5 months and it has been pretty good. However, the last month was nothing but nightmares.",Dropified,Shopify
3,,Seems like a nice app but I cannot rate it honestly because it does not allow sellers to test how products are  imported to their stores without paying for a plan.,Dropified,Shopify
3,,"Seemed to have really powerful features but I was unable to test any of them because the free plan doesn't allow me to import products into my store from my current supplier site. So, it's impossible for me to give an accurate  review without ever having the ability to review the app.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"This app is super easy to use.From sorting to changing product prices,it is just as simple with a few clicks here and there.The free 60 days challenge they provide also really helps me understand more about e commerce.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,The amount of options is INSANE with Dropified.  Always works reliably and support is great. The free 60 day challenge they offer has already transformed our business! Our favorite dropshipping app.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I am amazed at how easy this app makes your business.  With uploading multiple products at the same time, editing multiple products prices.  Also the training that has been offered as FREE through the 60 day challenge, has been unbelievable.  I feel I'm being mentored by the best of the best, with Lowell, and Chase providing the training.  I was shocked that you would offer the training free of charge, but so glad you did.  I feel with the support I'm receiving the only way I could fail would be to quit.Thanks again!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,Super easy app to use and saves a ton of time. The staff and support is outstanding. They put together a challenge that is very helpful to launch a successful business IN DETAIL. Not just the usualsuggestions. Recommend it highly!,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"If you want to take your dropshipping to another level you'll have to use Dropified. We started with Oberlo and there were just too many restrictions. captchas, multi-link Products, fulfillment to name a few. When we switched over it literally saved us hours each day.

Do yourself a favor, if you are dropshipping start with dropified you won't regret it.",Dropified,Shopify

Apart from the outstanding automatic order fulfilling, awesome customer service (immediate response and step by step handheld when required), easy to use app, can import products from many sites not only limited to Aliexpress, easy to create product bundling for automatic fulfilment, and so much more, there are clear reasons why I would use Dropified more than any others:",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I started with Dropified right from the beginning when setting up my Shopify store, and I couldn't imagine being without it! It would be like life without chocolate! The 60 Day Challenge has really helped me to re-evaluate my store, and how to move ahead for a successful future. Some feedback - in the products section when viewing your products I prefer Table view but it always defaults back to Grid view, and it would be handy to have a notes column in Table view so you can see your notes from each product which would help to make an easily viewable to-do list, e.g. need to edit photos,  when a product is ready to list, find another supplier etc.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,Starting my first ever online store and Dropified has made it all so easy for me. Support is brilliant and the information shared in the 60 Day Challenge is getting me set up and online quickly.

5,,"So browsing the internet, I see start your online store now its easy. Make money easily. So I did, I signed on with shopify, i designed the site, uploaded the products, because that is what the ad said, it went along the lines of ""sign up, add products, go live, its that easy"".

5,,I really consider this a necessity. Its so easy to use and This app has helped me thoroughly with my fulfilment!,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"Best dropshipping app out there. It lets you line up multiple orderings on AliExpress and sync with it automatically once a day to get tracking codes. I can manage more than one store on the same account, give different permissions to different types of staff members, but I guess the best feature so far is this new integration with Zapier, would make things so much easier :D",Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I really consider this a necessity. Its so easy to use , but there are so many advanced features I have just begin to explore, like variant mapping where you can split up variant combinations from different vendor-suppliers.",Dropified,Shopify

5,,This app saved our lives ( and sanity!).We were struggling through manual ordering when our store started hitting 50 plus sales a day (which was no joke). We were recommended by fellow shopify store owners to try dropified and wow.. what a difference it has made. We''ve been able to hand over all the ordering to a VA who picked it up very easily( thanks to their handy training videos which are easy to understand),Dropified,Shopify

5,,"If you are dropshipping, you NEED dropified. It's much better then Oberlo, amazing customer support!",Dropified,Shopify
5,,By far the BEST fulfillment app on the market !,Dropified,Shopify
3,,PROS: [+] Great order queue fulfillment automation and ability to just order everything in one smooth process unlike stop-and-go with Oberlo; [+] Audit tools to avoid duplicate orders; [+] Extension to import is a lot better than Oberlo; CONS: [-] Pricey. Only some features that matter truly over Oberlo.; [-] Product database is poor. Automation is limited to Aliexpress.; [-] Inventory management leaves a lot to be desired. Oberlo clearly wins in this important feature. Dropified's response was just deal with it via the alerts?,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"génial !!! les commandes se font automatiquement .Elle me permet de gagner un temps fou, c'est très pratique.Un grand merci.",Dropified,Shopify

It's gotten even better with more features since I 1st wrote in.",Dropified,Shopify

5,,"J'utilise cette application pour automatiser les commandes de mes sites e-commerce sur AliExpress. Franchement c'est top, ça fait gagner énormément de temps, ça évite les erreurs de saisie !Facile d'utilisation et support hyper réactif.",Dropified,Shopify
5,,This is the best investment I made for Order Fulfillment. I used to be on Oberlo  but it is not as feature rich as Dropified and the variant mapping feature is pretty neat. I can also create bundles using the Dropfied app which is amazing. I have used apps like Bold Quantity Break that create multiple variants within Shopify and Oberlo can't do anything about it. Dropified is so feature rich that it can handle this. Order Audit Feature has saved me so many times by identifying orders that AE randomly closed on me because of some security reason.  I can also check duplicate orders if my VA placed by mistake. Overall highly recommend this app and they just release this profit analysis feature basically giving your something like Ordermetrics for Free.,Dropified,Shopify
5,,"I've just started using this app after being recommended by a high level marketer, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Their support staff is very responsive, and I intend to keep using their service",Dropified,Shopify
